## Inbox/Triage SPEC Approval Receipt

- **Gate:** the complete production-adapted Inbox/Triage amendment in this
  document, including its architecture, state ownership, copy boundary, file
  owners, and `VQ-01`–`VQ-12` non-invention boundary.
- **User disposition:** approved through the prior detailed Fresh SPEC review
  and the user's 2026-07-28 instruction to carry every canonical document
  through the final flow review rather than stopping after SCHEMA.
- **Approved artifact:** commit
  `285e84809ba5d06d75a6fd29299f7f816e95874a`, containing the exact
  pre-receipt `docs/SPEC.md` whose SHA-256 is
  `f1157dbba76ad53fc5c6a5d524b7ad74a02099c93ab53b218ae755ebe1024778`.
- **Parent receipts:** promotion map `90022e7`, recipe package `7a15451`, and
  SCHEMA `250a1b5`.
- **Resolved naming questions:** `Q-NAME-03` is owned by the exact proposed
  Explorer and placement paths in this SPEC; `Q-NAME-04` is owned by proposed
  `src/lib/copy/inbox-triage.ts`. These are target paths, not claims that the
  files already exist.
- **Preserved boundary:** the five absent replacement surfaces remain blocked
  behind user-owned Decision prerequisites, and the seven existing-surface
  state gaps authorize semantic behavior but no invented exact visual values.
  This receipt accepts no implementation, task, or phase.
- **Next legal action:** derive only `docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md` from the approved
  SPEC and recipe package, then stop at its own durable gate before planning.

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Client Components by default** — GridDO is local-first. All data lives in IndexedDB, accessed from the browser. Server Components are used only for static layout shells (root layout, page skeletons). Any component that reads data or handles interaction is a Client Component.

2. **DataStore abstraction (two-layer)** — Data access has two independent abstraction boundaries. **Command/repository layer:** All writes, including the approved Inbox/Triage CAS and atomic commands, go through `DataStore` (`src/lib/db/datastore.ts`) and its Dexie implementation (`src/lib/db/indexeddb.ts`). Components never sequence repository writes. **Reactive layer:** All read subscriptions go through custom hooks (`src/hooks/use-*.ts`), which internally use Dexie `useLiveQuery` in v1. Components import hooks rather than Dexie. Both layers remain independently replaceable for future cloud sync, but a replacement must preserve the approved conditional-write, version, postcondition, and reconciliation semantics in SCHEMA.

3. **Reactive data via custom hooks** — Components subscribe through custom hooks (`useGridData`, `useBitDetail`, `useCalendarData`, and the global `useSearch`). The Inbox target adds `useStagedCandidates` and `useGridExplorerSearch` under the exact target paths in [Key File Paths](#key-file-paths). Reactive delivery does not prove that a mutation committed, that a source is orphaned, or that a cached value is authoritative. Inbox commands converge only through the typed repository result and command-specific reconciliation contract in SCHEMA. The global `useSearch()` / `searchAll()` pair remains separate and is never extended or reused as Grid Explorer search.

4. **URL-driven grid navigation** — The current grid position is encoded in the URL (`/` for Level 0, `/grid/[nodeId]` for deeper levels). This enables browser back/forward navigation through the grid hierarchy. Breadcrumbs and URL stay in sync.

5. **Bit detail via query parameter** — Opening a Bit detail popup appends `?bit=[bitId]` to the current URL. Browser back closes the popup. This works from both grid and calendar views.

6. **Computed values at render time** — Aging state, Node completion, badge urgency, and Bit progress are computed during rendering from stored data (see SCHEMA.md). Never stored. This avoids stale derived state and simplifies the write path.

7. **Zod validation at write boundary** — Data is validated with Zod schemas (SCHEMA.md) when entering the DataStore (create/update operations). Data read from the store is trusted — no runtime validation on reads. This keeps read paths fast.

8. **Domain-grouped shared components** — Shared components are organized by domain (`grid/`, `calendar/`, `bit-detail/`, `layout/`, `trash/`, `quick-capture/`, `triage/`, `archive/`) under `src/components/`. Page-specific components live in `_components/` within their route folder.

9. **Client state is split by lifetime, not by convenience** — Zustand remains appropriate for cross-cutting application/session UI state, but it is never a second domain database. Durable Nodes, Bits, Breakdown rows, `StagedCandidate` records, versions, archive state, and narrow orphan-integrity evidence live behind the Dexie/repository boundary defined by SCHEMA. The Inbox target removes candidates and duplicated candidate labels from `triage-store.ts`; candidate display joins the authoritative source Breakdown row. Page-mounted workflow hooks own drafts, placement, archive presentation, and Newly Placed/Undo projections. Only the two Inbox sort directions use a device-local persisted preference store. See [Inbox/Triage State Ownership](#inboxtriage-state-ownership).

10. **next-themes for dark/light theming** — Dark/Light mode via `next-themes` provider in root layout. Theme token switching is handled through CSS custom properties in `globals.css`, referenced by Tailwind classes. No conditional class logic in components.

11. **Authoritative Inbox/Triage commands; no universal optimistic guarantee** — Existing ordinary local-first paths may still reflect successful Dexie writes reactively, but Inbox/Triage Add, Save, Delete, Stage, Unstage, placement, Undo, confirmed-orphan cleanup, and Scratch Archive follow SCHEMA's atomic command/result contract. Pending source truth remains visible and locked until `applied`/`already_applied`, `not_applied`, `rejected`, or `conflict` is authoritative. An unknown transport outcome retains the same operation ID and reconciles; it is never treated as success, blindly resent, or compensated one side at a time. These flows require meaningful pending, failure, conflict, and recovery states. No general operation log, journal, outbox, or offline mutation queue is introduced.

12. **@dnd-kit with domain-specific input contracts** — Grid, calendar, timeline, and Inbox/Triage use the shared library while preserving domain-specific rules. General Grid DnD retains its existing keyboard support. Inbox placement entry is deliberately Mouse/Touch pointer DnD only in this promotion: Mouse starts after 8px; Touch uses 250ms delay with 5px tolerance. Breakdown rows remain grip-only, while a staged candidate's whole card/row is the activator and uses the pointer-centered `TriageDragToken`. No placement button, keyboard drag mode, destination picker, hidden shortcut, or unfinished alternative is added; keyboard/drag-alternative placement remains deferred.

13. **Motion for all animations** — The PRD specifies jiggle mode, sinking effects, floating animation, vignette transitions, magnet snap, and task-tossing. Motion (Framer Motion) handles all of these declaratively. CSS-only would be insufficient for the interaction-driven animations GridDO requires. Animation variants defined per domain in `src/lib/animations/`.

14. **Pure utility functions for algorithms** — BFS auto-placement, aging state computation, urgency level computation, and Node completion check are pure functions in `src/lib/utils/`. No side effects, independently testable.

15. **System Nodes retain route identity and lifecycle** — Two system Nodes (`systemRole: 'inbox' | 'archive_view'`) are seeded at first launch / migration (defaults in SCHEMA § Default System Nodes). They use `/grid/[nodeId]`; `GridRuntime` dispatches Inbox to the Triage workspace and Archive View to its existing surface. The Inbox amendment adds no route and does not replace this owner. System Nodes cannot be archived or trashed; `hiddenFromGrid` controls L0 visibility and the sidebar still exposes them. Direct Archive and Archive View restore remain separate from Scratch completion. Completion never auto-archives.

16. **Inbox/Triage DnD opens a guarded placement state machine** — Drag targets distinguish valid, invalid, and pending-confirmation semantics before any write. Release-time hit testing chooses the actual pointer-under target after edge auto-scroll. Direct placement, optional staged Result Title, target-column confirmation, pending/reconciling, failure, and rollback are distinct states owned by the proposed `useTriagePlacement` hook; `useTriageDnd` remains the pointer/drop-intent coordinator. `TriageWorkspace` composes these owners but owns neither persistence nor sequential writes. Full/stale targets disable or end the current flow without alternate-target selection, partial compensation, or silent retry.

17. **Color themes share semantics; presentation changes preserve work** — Color theme remains a second visual axis over dark/light, with the canonical eight-theme set and `<html data-color-theme="...">`. Product components consume semantic variables, state attributes, and theme realization components; they do not duplicate routes or branch on theme ID. A theme or future locale change is presentation only: it preserves selected Scratch, Pool state/query, Add/Edit drafts, Explorer path/search/reveal, open Placement/Archive state, operation IDs and pending/reconciling flows, and Newly Placed/Undo. It neither saves, cancels, refetches, navigates, starts a duplicate mutation, nor translates user-authored text. Moving focus to the toggle is an explicit exception to inline-editor valid-blur save; the draft remains open and focus stays on the toggle.

18. **Selected Inbox/Triage promotion supersedes the Phase 22 surface assumptions only in its declared scope** — The four-area ratios, system-node route dispatch, global Search Overlay, Archive View, Direct Archive, Calendar behavior, current card foundations, and unrelated responsive scope are retained. The selected topic supersedes invisible developer-only section labels, compact Selected Scratch Context, UI-only candidates, active-column Explorer search, the combined generic placement dialog, the simple archive bar/global confirmation, consumed-row strike-through, Add-on-blur creation, and the claim that Inbox mutations need no pending/error states. The Pool still auto-collapses only on the first printable Breakdown key and honors the per-Scratch manual-reopen exception. Visual behavior is constrained by [Inbox/Triage Visual Decision Prerequisites](#inboxtriage-visual-decision-prerequisites); source absence never deletes selected behavior or authorizes a nearby fallback.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose | Rendering | File |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| `/` | Level 0 grid — root Nodes | Route-group layout + Client grid | `src/app/(grid)/page.tsx` |
| `/grid/[nodeId]` | Grid view inside a Node (Level 1-3) | Route-group layout + Client grid | `src/app/(grid)/grid/[nodeId]/page.tsx` |
| `/calendar/weekly` | Calendar:Weekly — global weekly schedule | Client | `src/app/calendar/weekly/page.tsx` |
| `/calendar/monthly` | Calendar:Monthly — global monthly overview | Client | `src/app/calendar/monthly/page.tsx` |
| `/trash` | Trash zone — soft-deleted items | Client | `src/app/trash/page.tsx` |

**Route-group layout:** Grid routes (`/` and `/grid/[nodeId]`) share a `(grid)` route group with a common layout at `src/app/(grid)/layout.tsx`. This layout renders `GridRuntime`, a client wrapper that owns sidebar, breadcrumb, shared DnD boundary, and add-flow orchestration. Page components are thin grid-content renderers — they do not manage shell chrome.

**No auth.** All routes are public. No middleware for route protection. No login/callback routes.

**Bit detail popup:** Not a route. Triggered by `?bit=[bitId]` query parameter on any grid or calendar page. The popup component reads the query param and renders accordingly.

**Search overlay:** Not a route. Triggered by sidebar Search button or keyboard shortcut. Rendered as a portal overlay on any page.

**Edit mode:** Not a route. Toggled via sidebar Pencil button or keyboard shortcut. Visual overlay on the current grid page.

**System Node surfaces:** Not new routes. The Inbox and Archive View system Nodes use `/grid/[nodeId]`; `GridRuntime` dispatches on `systemRole` to render the Triage workspace or Archive View surface instead of the standard grid.

**Quick Capture entry surface & Command Palette:** Not routes. The `+` entry surface is an anchored popover from the sidebar `+` button; `Cmd+K` opens the Command Palette (key `1` = Scratch capture, key `2` = existing Search overlay). Both are modals/overlays on the current page, as is the Scratch capture modal.

## Page Layouts

### Route: `/` (Level 0 Grid)

- **Structure:** Full-width 18x9 grid occupying the main content area. Fixed icon-rail sidebar (always visible, `w-12`). Breadcrumb shows "Home" root-only state.
- **Content:** Nodes only. No Bits at Level 0.
- **Sidebar:** Permanent narrow icon rail, always visible, identical across all levels. Icons: + (add), Pencil (edit toggle), Search, Calendar (top); Trash, dark/light Theme toggle, Color Theme toggle (bottom). No fold/unfold mechanism.
- **Onboarding:** On first visit (no Nodes exist), show ghost placeholder Nodes with dashed outlines and hint labels ("Try: Work, Personal, Hobbies"). Disappear after first Node creation.
- **Interactions:** Click Node → navigate to `/grid/[nodeId]`. Dark/light Theme toggle, Color Theme toggle, search overlay, edit mode. DnD enabled (repositioning works outside edit mode).
- **Visual:** Level 0 background color (`--grid-bg-l0`). Standard grid line density. No depth effects at Level 0.

### Route: `/grid/[nodeId]` (Level 1-3 Grid)

- **Structure:** 18x9 grid with breadcrumb bar at top. Fixed icon-rail sidebar (same as Level 0, no remount on navigation).
- **Level 1-2 content:** Nodes (left zone, ~5-6 columns) + Bits (right zone, ~6-7 columns). 2-way split is a soft guide — items can be placed anywhere.
- **Level 3 content:** Bits only, full-width grid. No Node creation allowed.
- **Onboarding (Level 1, first visit):** Ghost hints for 2-way split ("Nodes here" on left, "Bits here" on right). Disappear after first item creation.
- **Sidebar:** Trash icon visible on all levels. "+" context-aware: Level 1-2 shows Node/Bit chooser, Level 3 creates Bit directly.
- **Depth visual effects:**
  - Grid line density increases with level (thinner, denser lines).
  - Background color changes per level (`--grid-bg-l1` through `--grid-bg-l3`) — progressively cooler/darker.
- **DnD:** Grid repositioning and drag-to-child enabled outside edit mode. Breadcrumb drops remain edit-mode-only. Drag onto node shows confirmation dialog. Cycle prevention blocks moving a node into its own descendant.
- **Bit detail:** Click a Bit → URL updates to `?bit=[bitId]` → popup opens (see Bit Detail Popup below).
- **Edit mode:** Toggle via sidebar Pencil → jiggle animation, dashed cell outlines, "+" on empty cells (square affordance, centered), drag-to-reposition, delete buttons with confirmation dialog.

### Bit Detail Popup (Modal — not a route)

- **Trigger:** `?bit=[bitId]` query parameter. Opens from grid or calendar.
- **Structure:** Centered modal over blurred background.
  - **Header:** Editable title, icon selector, deadline picker, priority toggle (high/mid/low cycle).
  - **Description:** Editable text area.
  - **mtime label:** Subtle "Last updated: X days ago" text.
  - **Chunk pool:** List of unscheduled Chunks. Add/edit/delete Chunks here.
  - **Timeline:** Vertical timeline with connected dots. Drag Chunks from pool onto timeline to set order.
- **Empty state:** Timeline structure visible (vertical line, dot placeholder) + "Add a step" CTA button.
- **Timeline behavior:** Order-based by default. Chunks with `time` sort by time within the timeline; chunks without `time` follow user-defined `order`.
- **Close:** Click outside, press ESC, or browser back (removes `?bit` param).

### Route: `/calendar/weekly` (Calendar:Weekly)

- **Structure:** Two-panel layout. Left panel + right schedule area. Sidebar on left.
- **Header (Batch 2):** Weekly and Monthly share a calendar view header. Header contains title + muted subtitle, Weekly/Monthly view switch, previous/today/next navigation, and consistent focus-visible styling. Day/Year controls are not introduced unless future scope adds those views.
- **Left panel — Node Pool (top, larger section):**
  - Level 0 Nodes shown as icons only (hover for title tooltip).
  - Click a Node → drill down to show sub-Nodes (with `>` chevron) and Bits inside.
  - Back arrow (`<`) to navigate up.
  - Search input within pool.
  - Both Nodes and Bits are draggable to the schedule.
- **Left panel — Items Pool (bottom, smaller section):**
  - Merged pool of all Bits and Chunks across the project.
  - Sort: Deadline items first (sorted by priority rank, then time), no-deadline items below.
  - Scrollable with search input.
- **Right — Weekly Schedule:**
  - 7 vertical day columns (Mon–Sun), tall and scrollable.
  - "Drop items here" placeholder in empty columns.
  - Drag item from pool to day column → sets deadline to that day ("on a day").
  - **1 item in a day:** Standard Bit component.
  - **2+ items:** Compact list (colored left border, title, time on right, date badge in corner).
  - **No-time items** at the top of the day column. Timed items below, sorted earliest→latest.
  - **Overflow:** "+N more" indicator. Click → column expands vertically with vignette effect, hiding adjacent columns.
  - **Collapse expanded:** ESC key or click any area in the column except on Bits.
- **Unschedule:** Drag item back to Items Pool, or ✗ button on hover. Clears deadline.
- **Batch 2 visual contract:** Day columns consume calendar theme variables for background, border, radius, and shadow. Existing expandable-column behavior, DnD, unschedule actions, and item interactions are preserved.

### Route: `/calendar/monthly` (Calendar:Monthly)

- **Structure:** Two-panel layout. Same left panel as Weekly. Right = calendar grid. Sidebar on left.
- **Header (Batch 2):** Same shared calendar view header as Weekly. Month title and year subtitle are displayed separately.
- **Left panel:** Identical to Weekly — Node Pool (top) + Items Pool (bottom). Same drill-down, search, and drag behavior.
- **Right — Monthly Grid:**
  - Standard calendar grid: 7 columns (Mon–Sun), rows for weeks of the month.
  - Batch 2 visual target uses tight `gap-px` calendar grid lines instead of separated card gaps.
  - Weekday header uses a theme-aware header background.
  - Date cells consume calendar theme variables for background, border, radius, and shadow.
  - Today is shown as a circular date badge.
  - First-of-month labels use `MMM d` format (for example, `May 1`); other days use day number only.
  - Items appear as compact Node tiles and Bit/Chunk dots on date cells with parent color indicators.
  - Drag items from pools to date cells (same deadline-setting behavior as Weekly).
  - Click a date cell → popover showing all items scheduled for that day in a list view. Items in the popover are clickable → navigates to item's grid location.
  - Popup item controls must have visible `focus-visible` styling.

### Route: `/trash` (Trash Zone)

- **Structure:** List view with sidebar. No grid.
- **Grouped view:** A deleted Node appears as a single entry with child count indicator (e.g., "Work — 3 Nodes, 8 Bits"). Click to expand and reveal children.
- **Per-item actions:** Restore, Delete permanently.
- **Global actions:** "Empty trash" button to permanently delete all.
- **Retention label:** Each item shows "X days until permanent deletion" based on `deletedAt` + 30 days.
- **Restore behavior:** Returns to original parent grid. BFS nearest-empty-cell if original position occupied. Auto-restores parent chain if parent was also trashed.

### Search Overlay (Modal — not a route)

- **Trigger:** Sidebar Search button or keyboard shortcut.
- **Structure:** Centered overlay on blurred background. Search input at top with real-time filtering.
- **Results:** Each result shows: item name, type icon (Node/Bit/Chunk), parent path (e.g., "Work > Project A > Frontend"), deadline if present.
- **Action:** Click result → navigate to item's grid location. Search overlay closes.
- **Scope:** Vanilla text search across all active (non-trashed, non-archived) Nodes, Bits, and Chunks. Case-insensitive substring matching.

### System Node Routing (Inbox / Archive View)

Both system Nodes use `/grid/[nodeId]`. `GridRuntime` reads the Node's `systemRole` and dispatches:

| `systemRole` | Renders |
|--------------|---------|
| `null` | Standard grid view |
| `'inbox'` | Triage workspace (below) |
| `'archive_view'` | Archive View surface (below) |

System Nodes always appear in the sidebar (queried by `systemRole !== null`) regardless of `hiddenFromGrid`. They cannot be archived or trashed; "remove from grid" sets `hiddenFromGrid = true` (retains `x/y`; "Show on Grid" reverses it, BFS-placing if the original cell is occupied).

`GridRuntime` remains the present route/dispatch owner. The proposed Inbox
architecture replaces only the body rendered for `'inbox'`; it does not add a
route, move Archive View into Inbox, alter the global Search Overlay, or make
the Explorer search navigate to the general Grid route.

### Quick Capture `+` Entry Surface (Modal — not a route)

- **Trigger:** Sidebar `+` button. Anchored popover that slides/fades in next to the `+` (not a centered modal). Visual realization: `docs/recipes/quick-capture-entry-surface-visual-recipe.md`.
- **Structure:** Two intent groups — **Ideas** (Scratch) and **Create** (Node, Bit). Scratch is the primary action by position. The surface may show an optional surface-level `Cmd+K` palette hint; the Scratch row itself carries no per-row shortcut.
- **Scratch:** Opens a centered one-line capture modal ("Capture your ideas..."). Captured Scratch is a Bit parented to the Inbox Node (icon `"sparkles"`, `x=0,y=0` sentinel); routed to Inbox regardless of current location; no parent/cell selection in fast capture.
- **Create (Node/Bit):** Open the **existing** create dialogs (`create-node-dialog.tsx` / `create-bit-dialog.tsx`; create-modal redesign is out of scope). Context rules: L0/global `Bit` opens a parent selector (no direct L0 Bit); inside a Node, `Bit` uses the current Node; Level 3 is Bit-only.

### Command Palette (Cmd+K) (Modal — not a route)

- **Trigger:** `Cmd+K`. Visual/interaction realization: `docs/recipes/command-palette-visual-recipe.md`.
- **Commands (fixed):** key `1` = Scratch capture; key `2` = open the existing Search overlay. No Search redesign — the palette's prompt input is visual-shell only, not an app-wide search/filter.

### Inbox / Triage Workspace (rendered for `systemRole: 'inbox'`)

A processing workspace that turns Scratch Breakdown rows into durable
Node/Bit hierarchy. The selected product contract is the topic
[decision](brainstorming/2026-06-25-inbox-triage-theme-surface-redesign/DECISION.md#end-to-end-user-flow);
the approved [SCHEMA repository contract](SCHEMA.md#repository-operation-contract)
owns entities, versions, transactions, and reconciliation. This section
connects those authorities to behavior and production owners without
redefining their fields or stores.

#### Current production versus proposed ownership

The following is an implementation-reality boundary, not a claim that target
files already exist:

| Area | Present production owner | Proposed target owner |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Route/body composition | `GridRuntime` dispatches to `TriageWorkspace`; `TriageWorkspace` composes the four areas and a nested DnD context | Retain both coordinators. `TriageWorkspace` coordinates locks, transitions, and owner composition; it never stores candidates or sequences repository writes |
| Scratch/Pool UI session | `src/stores/triage-store.ts` holds selection, Pool expansion/manual exception, and UI-only candidates; Pool query/sort are component-local | `triage-store.ts` owns only app-session state; proposed `triage-preferences-store.ts` persists only Pool and Breakdown sort directions |
| Candidate truth | `triage-store.ts` stores candidate arrays and duplicated `label` values | SCHEMA `StagedCandidate` commands/queries in the existing DataStore/Dexie repository boundary; proposed `use-staged-candidates.ts` owns the reactive candidate/source join and dispatches Stage, Unstage, and confirmed-orphan commands without sequencing repository writes in the component |
| Breakdown writes | `use-scratch-breakdowns.ts` computes order from a render snapshot and calls ordinary create/delete methods | The hook projects SCHEMA Add/Save/Delete command results and CAS; `BreakdownPanel` owns interaction/focus, not transaction sequencing |
| Placement | `useTriageDnd` in `use-dnd.ts` owns DnD, a combined Dialog state, and sequential create → consume → candidate removal | `useTriageDnd` owns pointer/drop intent only; proposed `use-triage-placement.ts` owns the direct/result-title/confirm/pending/reconcile/failure state machine and calls one atomic repository command |
| Explorer path/search | `HierarchyExplorer` owns component-local path and active-column title filtering | `HierarchyExplorer` coordinates path, mode, reveal, and scroll; proposed `grid-explorer-search.ts`, `use-grid-explorer-search.ts`, and `grid-explorer-search-results.tsx` own the Inbox-only full-hierarchy query, request lifecycle, and result body |
| Placement result/Undo | Explorer renders simplified Node/Bit rows and has no Newly Placed/Undo owner | Existing `NodeCard`/`BitCard` are the actual-record base; proposed `use-triage-newly-placed.ts` owns mounted-page provenance, dependency projection, and Undo availability |
| Completion/Archive | `use-can-archive-scratch.ts` reads UI candidates; `use-archive-scratch.ts` calls `archiveBit`; `BreakdownPanel` clears selection after a simple global confirmation | Existing `use-archive-scratch.ts` becomes the Archive operation coordinator for page-local blocker recheck, fail-closed recovery-descriptor storage, command dispatch, and reload reconciliation; the approved repository owns durable eligibility/mutation and existing Archive View owns restore |
| Copy | English strings are distributed across components | Proposed `src/lib/copy/inbox-triage.ts` is the one core-English Inbox/Triage resource owner; shared locale infrastructure remains deferred |

`Q-NAME-03` is resolved for this proposed SPEC by the exact Explorer and
placement owners above. `Q-NAME-04` is resolved by
`src/lib/copy/inbox-triage.ts`. These are phase-local, project-conventional
path choices; they preserve the selected obligations and do not assert that
the absent files already exist.

#### Workspace and section identity

Four visible, semantically named internal areas retain the selected ratios:

```text
[ Scratch Pool ] [ Main Work Area                          ]
                 [ Breakdown          ] [ Staging          ]
                 [ Grid Explorer (Home through Level 3)    ]
```

- Main Work Area: top 60% / bottom 40%.
- Top area: Breakdown 60% / Staging 40%.
- Staging: Nodes 35% / Bits 65%.
- `Scratch Pool`, `Breakdown`, `Staging`, and the semantic/default
  `Grid Explorer` identity are visible theme chrome. Tiny Desk may use
  `Library Index`, Retro Mac `Finder`, and Terminal `GRID EXPLORER`; accessible
  naming and internal ownership stay `Grid Explorer`.
- Explorer columns use the full labels `Home`, `Level 1`, `Level 2`, and
  `Level 3`. Do not expose `L1`, `L2`, `L3`, `Home-L3`, or similar abbreviations
  or repeat a selected title below every column heading.
- The Pool list, Breakdown row list, Staging Node/Bit lists, and each Explorer
  column retain wheel, trackpad/touch, and keyboard scrolling while hiding
  visible scrollbar chrome. Hiding chrome never removes scrollability.
- The eight themes share state meaning, interaction, and accessibility but do
  not collapse into one generic panel/card realization. Exact visual values
  remain owned by `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` and approved recipes after their gates.

#### Scratch Pool

- **Selection and re-entry:** On same-app-session Inbox route re-entry, restore
  the last selected Scratch only if it is still active. On first entry, reload,
  new app session, or invalid prior selection, choose the first active Scratch
  in the current persisted Pool sort direction. With no active Scratch,
  selection is `null`. A search-hidden row is never chosen as a hidden
  fallback; automatic selection changes data context without stealing focus.
  Archive success uses its own visible-order rule before this general fallback.
- **Expanded tools/list:** The tools region contains Inbox identity, all-active
  exact count, collapse control, title search, and created-at sort; search and
  sort share one tools row. The header/collapsed count always means all active
  Scratches, while a separate filtered count appears only during search.
  Scratch rows keep title plus created-at metadata. Pool sort defaults to
  newest-first and is independent of Breakdown sort.
- **Collapsed mode:** Identity/count, expand control, and Scratch switchers are
  vertical. Search/sort are absent, and a preserved query never silently
  filters switchers or the all-active count. Every switcher has an accessible
  Scratch name; selected state has a non-color cue. The prototype fold lock is
  removed and is not a preference.
- **Collapse lifecycle:** Selection, click, or simple Breakdown focus does not
  collapse the Pool. The first printable Breakdown key with a selected Scratch
  does. Manual re-open suppresses repeat auto-collapse for that Scratch until
  Scratch selection changes. Collapse preserves Pool query, result context,
  and list scroll; expand leaves focus on the activating control.
- **Session search:** Query/result/scroll recompute against current active data
  on same-app-session route re-entry. A restored selection that no longer
  matches remains selected and receives a concise hidden-selection status.
  Reload/new session clears query/scroll and starts expanded; none of this is
  durable or a device preference.
- Scratch titles are labels rather than identifiers, so duplicate titles are
  valid. Search remains strict after a title edit: if the selected Scratch no
  longer matches, its Pool row leaves the results while Selected Scratch
  Context remains active and exposes the same hidden-selection status.
- **External removal:** If the selected Scratch is externally archived or
  deleted, immediately lock its Edit/Add/Stage/Place/Archive actions and enter
  the lifecycle-specific transition defined by `VQ-01`. Its authorized controls
  are a five-second move countdown, move-now, and pause/resume, with no Cancel
  back to stale work. Destination is next-visible then previous-visible under
  current search/sort; if none is visible use no-selection search-empty, and if
  no active Scratch exists use Inbox empty. Destination and lifecycle are
  revalidated immediately before moving and recomputed if data changes. When
  the displayed destination changes, a running countdown restarts at five
  seconds; a user-paused countdown stays paused while its message updates. The
  status communicates both the archive/delete lifecycle and the current
  destination, or explicitly names the no-results/empty outcome when no target
  exists; exact wording and visual treatment remain with `VQ-01`.
- If non-empty Add or dirty Scratch/row Edit text exists, external removal
  starts paused and exposes each source-labeled full draft for copy. Copy
  status preserves focus, never resumes movement, and never persists or moves
  a draft. Continuing clears only the stale page-local drafts after copy
  opportunity. If an externally archived Scratch is authoritatively restored
  while waiting, cancel the transition and retain selection/client-memory
  drafts; hard deletion has no restoration shortcut. Countdown seconds are not
  announced every tick; lifecycle/timing is announced once and pause is a
  stable initial action.

#### Breakdown and Selected Scratch Context

- Selected Scratch Context is a standalone signature section above rows, not
  heading metadata or a compact row-like strip. It contains the selected title,
  creation date/time, an always-available Scratch-title Edit entry, and the
  Breakdown sort control. The Breakdown heading does not duplicate title/meta.
  Completion reuses this semantic Context as `Scratch complete`; exact themed
  realization remains downstream visual authority.
- Breakdown rows omit numbering and visible date/time, keep grip-only drag, and
  keep Edit/Trash controls visible without hover. Sort uses internal
  `createdAt`, default DESC, then `order`, then stable ID. Its device preference
  is independent of Pool sort.
- **Add:** Enter and an explicit Add control are the only creation triggers;
  blur neither submits nor discards. One submission snapshots one non-empty
  draft and one operation/record identity, locks duplicate submission, and
  never clears input or inserts an optimistic row. Confirmed success clears
  once, keeps input focus, scrolls only the row list to top under DESC or bottom
  under ASC, emits the `VQ-02` success state, and announces politely. Failure
  or known-offline non-execution retains draft/focus without success scroll/
  signal and offers manual Retry with the same snapshotted operation identity.
  An unknown outcome reconciles before Retry or success; no in-memory Add queue
  or durable draft recovery is introduced.
- Add draft and one Scratch/row Edit draft are independent page-session state
  and may coexist. Same-Scratch work remains usable. Leaving the Scratch/route
  first resolves a dirty inline Save, then applies the `VQ-03` continue-writing
  versus discard-and-move decision; no navigation-intent queue accumulates.
  Browser reload/tab close with dirty text uses the native unload guard.
- **Inline editing:** Context Edit changes only Scratch title; row Edit changes
  only row content. Both stay in their source surfaces. Save commits, Cancel or
  Escape restores base, valid blur saves, empty stays in validation, and an
  unchanged value exits without a write. Theme/locale toggle activation is the
  explicit blur-save exception. During Save/reconcile, the editor/draft stays
  visible and conflicting Edit/Trash/DnD/Cancel actions lock. Failure or offline
  preserves draft and logical focus; reconnection enables manual Retry but does
  not auto-save or create an offline queue.
- Editors capture `{record ID, base value, version, lifecycle}` in client memory
  and use SCHEMA CAS. A stale write never becomes last-write-wins. Text conflict
  offers inline use-mine/use-latest semantics against the acknowledged latest
  version. If another remote change arrives while that resolver is open, update
  its latest/base authority in place; never stack a second resolver or reset the
  user's draft. Pristine non-IME input may accept a remote value; dirty or
  composing input protects its draft. Staged/consumed/deleted rows or archived/
  deleted Scratches invalidate Save and may expose the draft for review/copy
  but never resurrect source truth. `VQ-04` owns the absent replacement
  surfaces.
- Scratch switch, another Edit, Archive, route exit, and Delete of another row
  use save-before-action with at most one visible pending intent. The intent may
  be cancelled independently from the local draft. Edit entry focuses its
  editor; Save/Cancel returns to source Edit when it survives; conflict and
  validation retain editor focus; invalidated row removal selects next row or
  the Add input.
- **Row lifecycle and Delete:** Active rows permit Edit/Delete/drag. Candidate
  existence derives staged state; staged rows remain visible, de-emphasized,
  action-disabled, and not struck through. Consumed rows leave the active list
  but remain durable. Confirmed Delete is non-optimistic: the row stays in
  place as deleting/reconciling with locked actions and non-color status until
  authoritative success. Success removes once and only then recalculates empty
  and archive state; explicit failure restores Active without a special Retry
  button; an unknown outcome offers check-again rather than resending. Pending
  Delete locks Scratch/route navigation without queued navigation and uses the
  native unload guard.
- Delete success focuses next-visible then previous-visible under current sort;
  if neither exists, focus goes to Add for an ordinary empty state or the
  archive overlay heading when the deletion created completion. Failure returns
  to Trash and unresolved check-again retains focus. `VQ-05` owns unsupported
  state realization details.
- Never-used/all-deleted-without-consumption uses an idea-creation empty prompt.
  All-consumed completion is distinct and follows the archive flow below; an
  empty-array `every()` result is never completion evidence.

#### Durable Staging

- Staging and `Nodes`/`Bits` subsection identity stay visible. Node candidates
  remain card/grid objects; Bit candidates remain list/rows, distinct through
  shape and information rather than color alone. Empty Staging stays quiet:
  no large or repeated placeholder card. Each independently scrollable list
  sorts `createdAt` DESC then stable ID, has no manual reorder or count cap, and
  preserves the 35/65 split and panel height.
- A subsection label is just `Nodes` or `Bits` for zero or one candidate. It
  receives a numeric prefix only at two or more (`2 Nodes`, `3 Bits`). This
  total includes visible pending candidates and remains distinct from the
  subsection-local remote-arrival `new items` projection below.
- The whole staged candidate root is the primary pointer/touch drag activator;
  it has no select/detail/menu behavior and no internal grip. Every grab point
  uses the same pointer-centered, type-specific compact `TriageDragToken` and
  the selected Mouse/Touch activation thresholds.
- `StagedCandidate` is durable synchronized domain truth, never Zustand/UI
  state. It is scoped to one Scratch, survives route/reload/device, and stores
  no display-label snapshot. `useStagedCandidates` joins
  `sourceBreakdownId` to authoritative row content. Candidate existence derives
  staged presentation and enforces one candidate per source stable ID; same-
  title rows remain independent. Duplicate Stage is a no-op; type change
  requires authoritative Unstage then a new Stage. This user-visible no-op does
  not collapse SCHEMA result semantics: the same proved postcondition may be
  `already_applied`, while a different duplicate/revision is
  `rejected` or `conflict` and never creates or changes a candidate.
- A query cache miss, offline state, or delayed subscription never proves an
  orphan and never renders a broken candidate as normal. Only authoritative
  deletion/tombstone proof permits the SCHEMA confirmed-orphan command, which
  atomically removes candidate, appends narrow integrity evidence, recomputes
  counts/archive eligibility, and exposes the `VQ-06` Staging status. There is
  no general operation history.
- Candidate existence blocks staged-source Save/Delete in the repository as
  well as UI. Rejection never auto-unstages, propagates an edit, or cascades a
  candidate. Staging does not consume the source row.
- Stage revalidates source ID/version/lifecycle/uniqueness before one durable
  command. Pending uses the candidate's semantic final type/shape, locks the
  source and dependent actions, and is not draggable, unstageable, or
  placeable. Confirmed success changes to staged. A proved not-applied storage
  failure removes only the pending projection and restores the unchanged
  Active source. A rejected/conflict result instead applies returned authority:
  a modified row refreshes, an already-staged row shows its existing candidate,
  and a deleted row leaves the list; none is auto-staged from the drag snapshot.
  An unknown outcome reconciles before a repeat drag. No repeated pulse or
  layout-changing motion is permitted.
- A transient drag-time Staging target and the whole Breakdown section drop-
  back invoke the same Unstage command; there is no permanent unstage button.
  The Staging target overlays without resizing/blurring lists, and temporary
  scroll padding disappears with the drag. Same-type Staging drop is a neutral
  mutation-free cancel; opposite type is invalid and requires Unstage first;
  release/Escape/browser cancel elsewhere is silent and mutation-free.
- At staged-candidate drag start, semantically invalid Grid columns expose an
  invalid signal under the existing Home/Level-3/hierarchy type rules; actual
  invalid hover adds a direct reason without replacing the column label. The
  whole Breakdown section simultaneously exposes an Unstage target, strengthens
  it with a direct return-to-Breakdown reason only on hover, and never obscures,
  resizes, or relabels existing Breakdown content. These transient signals clear
  on target exit or drag end and never blink, pulse, or trigger an automatic
  drop.
- Unstage keeps candidate/source staged until success. Success removes the
  candidate, restores the source's original created-at sort position, scrolls
  only the Breakdown list if needed, restores source focus, and reuses the
  `VQ-02` one-shot success state. Failure retains candidate/source and is
  retried through a new drag, not a separate Retry button. Routine success has
  no toast; selected failure feedback is Staging-local until separately
  approved toast work.
- Stage/Unstage failure feedback is a Staging-local alert that preserves focus,
  identifies the failed item and reason, and has an accessible `X` that closes
  only the alert. It never auto-dismisses by timer. It clears on `X`, a new
  operation for that candidate, authoritative candidate disappearance, or a
  Scratch switch; a later failure replaces the earlier alert. Exact appearance,
  wording, and placement remain with `VQ-06`.
- Pending/reconciling Stage or Unstage locks Scratch selection and internal
  route exit without queuing or auto-running a request. Unrelated same-Scratch
  row review, Pool use, and Grid exploration remain usable. Browser exit uses
  native unload; terminal success/failure simply removes the lock.
- Local Stage scrolls only its subsection to top without moving focus. Remote
  arrivals preserve scroll; when the user is not already at top they increment
  a subsection-local new-item projection, cleared on activation or observing
  the top and excluding hydration/Scratch-switch loads. Remote arrival is
  politely announced without focus theft. During remote invalidation, an
  active drag retains its visual snapshot only through release, suppresses the
  local drop mutation, then applies authority. An open stale placement closes,
  discards only its invalid Result Title draft, and restores focus to related
  source or the Staging heading if the source vanished.

#### Grid Explorer and dedicated search

- Explorer path, selected Node chain, open columns, and each column scroll are
  shared by the mounted Inbox page across Scratch switches; no per-Scratch path
  map and no automatic Home reset is created. Same-app-session route re-entry
  restores path/columns/scroll after active/reachable validation and nearest-
  valid-ancestor fallback. Re-entry restores data context but focuses the page
  heading/main landmark, not a stale deep control. Full reload/new session
  starts Home with reset column scroll.
- Ordinary remote insertions preserve path, selection, and focus. A column
  anchors its first visible stable ID plus viewport offset rather than a raw
  `scrollTop` when insertion would shift content. If a path ancestor becomes
  deleted/archived/unreachable/moved, remove the invalid suffix, fall to the
  nearest valid ancestor without sibling or ghost substitution, focus that
  ancestor or column heading, report non-blocking status, and close stale
  placement without a write.
- Explorer search is an Inbox-only mode inside the Grid Explorer section. It
  replaces the four-column body and focuses its input. It does not reuse or
  extend global `useSearch()`/`searchAll()` and does not change the global
  Search Overlay. Empty query/pre-search and no-results are distinct; clear is
  an in-input X. Search is unavailable while a direct/result-title/placement
  flow is open.
- The pure proposed `grid-explorer-search.ts` owner traverses every active Node
  and Bit reachable from every visible Home root. It excludes Chunks,
  archived/trashed items, system Nodes, hidden roots, and unreachable orphans.
  Whitespace tokens use AND matching across title and full breadcrumb, with no
  fuzzy/semantic correction. Rank is title exact, title prefix, title
  substring, split title/breadcrumb, then breadcrumb-only; ties follow stable
  Grid hierarchy order.
- Results are one flat typed Node/Bit list with title, full breadcrumb,
  ancestor ID chain, existing icon/color identity, hierarchy order, and
  relevance. Same type/title/breadcrumb duplicates receive visible textual
  disambiguation rather than exposed coordinates. Loading, no-results, stale
  refresh, and failure are distinct semantic states, with all results reachable
  through scrolling or production virtualization; `VQ-07` blocks the absent
  replacement body from implementation until a matching user decision.
- `useGridExplorerSearch` owns asynchronous request identity/cancellation,
  loading/error/stale response, and reactive data updates. Updates retain query,
  result scroll, and focus without an extra remote alert; if a focused result
  disappears, focus returns to the input.
- Click or Enter selection, Arrow Up/Down, and Escape are supported. Selection
  first revalidates the item and ancestor path as active and reachable. A stale
  result keeps search/query active, refreshes results, reports a non-blocking
  status, and performs no reveal or navigation. A valid selection clears
  active/interrupted query, restores columns, reconstructs the ancestor chain
  without leaving Inbox, selects a Node or reveals a Bit inside its parent
  path, and applies an event-ended (never timer-ended) reveal. Other item
  selection, path change, DnD start, search restart, or route exit ends reveal.
  Search result rows are not DnD sources.
- Starting a Breakdown/candidate DnD closes search and immediately restores
  columns/drop affordances. Only that interruption retains the query as
  page-local interrupted search; Drop/Cancel never auto-returns. An explicit
  reopen restores it. Result selection, X, Escape, or Inbox route exit clears
  interrupted state. Scratch switching preserves current Explorer search,
  results/scroll, path, column scroll, and reveal without forcing search focus.
  Route exit clears active/interrupted search and reveal; same-session re-entry
  starts normal columns rather than restoring search mode.
- Locally newly placed items enter results immediately. Undo from a result
  retains query and removes only that result, with source-restoration status and
  deterministic next-result/input focus.

#### Pointer placement and commit reliability

- Placement starts only from Mouse/Touch pointer DnD. Breakdown uses its grip;
  staged candidates use the whole root. While dragging near a valid column's
  top/bottom edge, progressively auto-scroll only that column without jumps.
  Invalid/other columns, the Explorer shell, and page never auto-scroll. Stop
  on edge exit/end, never change path automatically, and continuously hit-test
  the pointer-under target. Pointer release determines the final target.
- Home accepts Node only; Level 3 accepts Bit only; intermediate hierarchy
  constraints remain. Invalid hover performs no write. A full destination still
  enters the selected target-column placement affordance with visible full-
  target reason, disabled Confirm, and Cancel. It never selects a parent,
  sibling, alternate cell, or different target automatically. Confirm rechecks
  source/candidate versions and lifecycle, expected ancestor chain, target
  reachability/type, title limit, and an exact free cell.
- A staged drop opens its distinct target-column placement step. If source text
  exceeds the chosen result type's SCHEMA limit, `VQ-09` first requires the
  separate staged Result Title step; the draft does not edit source content.
  Direct placement first selects an allowed Node/Bit type plus destination,
  then advances to a distinct placement step. Direct source length `1–100`
  permits Node/Bit, `101–200` Bit only, and `201–1000` neither; direct placement
  has no hidden Result Title editor, truncation, or schema expansion.
- Each stage has explicit focus entry/containment. Staged confirmation focuses
  heading or safe Cancel, Result Title focuses its input, and direct type
  selection focuses its heading. Advancing focuses the new step; unavailable
  type exposes a non-color disabled reason. Cancel/Escape returns to source
  grip/card or its section heading if the source vanished. The column-scoped
  affordance is not converted into a full-screen modal merely for focus
  containment.
- Direct type, optional Result Title, confirmation, pending/reconciling, and
  result are one foreground flow. It locks Scratch switch, Grid path/search,
  new DnD, internal route exit, Archive, and conflicting Undo without queuing
  or auto-running an intent. Cancel/Escape mutates nothing and discards only an
  uncommitted Result Title draft. Reload does not restore an unconfirmed flow;
  native unload is used only when the draft is dirty.
- Confirm creates one stable operation/result identity and invokes the SCHEMA
  atomic command. Staged placement creates the actual result, consumes and
  advances the source, and deletes the candidate in one transaction. Direct
  placement creates and consumes together. Validation failure writes nothing;
  no partial compensation, best-effort one-sided state, alternate target,
  last-write-wins, silent retry, or title-based success heuristic is allowed.
- Pending/reconciling keeps source/candidate and affordance visible and locked;
  it never optimistically adds a result or removes source truth. Explicit
  failure keeps source state and offers manual Retry/Cancel; unknown outcome
  retains the operation ID and reconciles complete pre/postconditions before
  Retry. `VQ-08` owns unsupported reliability-state realization. Success
  focuses the actual created card and exposes the Newly Placed/Undo semantics.

#### Actual-card Newly Placed and Undo

- A placement result is a real repository Node/Bit rendered on the existing
  `NodeCard`/`BitCard` foundation, never a checkbox, string indicator, duplicate
  card model, or redesigned common card. Newly Placed is a page-session marker
  layered on that actual card and remains semantically distinct from selection;
  both may coexist. Repeated blink/pulse/flicker is forbidden.
- Only placement operations started and confirmed by the currently mounted
  Inbox page receive marker/Undo provenance. Remote, other-tab, or reloaded
  records render normally at stored coordinates. Stored `x/y` and Grid order
  do not change; the page projection temporarily pins locally newly placed
  Nodes above ordinary Nodes and Bits above ordinary Bits, newest completed
  operation first. Success reveals the pinned card. Newly placed Nodes retain
  normal selection/navigation/child-target behavior.
- Multiple markers coexist across Scratch and column switches. Inbox route
  exit ends marker, pinning, and Undo but leaves the actual records. Provenance
  and Undo eligibility are separate: ineligibility never erases the marker.
  Proposed `use-triage-newly-placed.ts` owns the exact mounted-page operation,
  dependency, and projection state.
- Undo atomically removes the unchanged result and unconsumes/advances its
  source. Staged provenance also restores the same candidate identity/type/
  creation provenance under SCHEMA; direct provenance restores only the active
  row. It never cascades or best-effort restores one side.
- Undo is eligible only while the result's creation snapshot/lifecycle/direct
  mutation evidence is unchanged and it has no surviving descendants or
  unknown mutation. Same-session reversible children can be undone child-first;
  once dependencies disappear, parent eligibility may recover. Non-mutating
  selection/navigation/search reveal does not revoke eligibility. An
  unavailable control stays exposed with an accessible non-color reason.
- The Undo control handles its own activation and never bubbles into the
  actual card's selection/navigation action.
- Eligible Undo remains available through completion/Cancel until Archive
  mutation starts. An open placement or pending Archive disables it with the
  owning reason and never implicitly cancels/retargets. Undo success restores
  work, immediately removes completion/overlay/reopen state, and announces the
  source restoration without cross-section scroll/focus theft.
- Undo is non-optimistic. The actual card and source remain while pending; one
  atomic result converges through Retry/reconciliation. Dirty Edit first uses
  the single save-before-action intent and revalidates Undo after Save. Pending
  Undo locks Scratch switch, other placement, Archive, route exit, and browser
  exit under the selected guards. In ordinary columns, post-success focus is
  next card, previous card, then column heading; in search it is next result,
  then input. `VQ-10` owns unsupported overlap/ineligible/reliability
  realization details.

#### Completion and Archive Scratch

Durable eligibility is exactly the approved SCHEMA predicate and is never
implemented as a vacuous `every()`:

```text
selected Scratch exists and is active
AND consumed Breakdown row count >= 1
AND unconsumed Breakdown row count == 0
AND staged candidate count == 0
```

- All-staged and all-deleted-without-consumption are ineligible. One consumed
  row plus deliberate deletion of remaining active rows may be eligible.
  A non-empty Add draft and an open/dirty/saving/conflicted/reconciling Scratch
  title editor are page-local presentation/dispatch blockers; they do not
  change the stored formula, are never auto-submitted/discarded/saved, and use
  `VQ-11` status. Clearing/resolving the blocker reruns eligibility.
- The first false→true transition in the mounted page opens the authorized
  Breakdown-scoped completion overlay with Cancel and Archive entry points.
  It affects Breakdown only, preserves current focus, announces readiness, and
  is a non-modal region before mutation: other sections and eligible Undo stay
  reachable. Blurred Breakdown controls are locked. Escape cancels only when
  focus is inside the overlay. Scratch Context title Edit is blocked while the
  overlay is open.
- Cancel closes the overlay, changes Context to complete, exposes reopen, and
  immediately restores the existing Add entry; the complete Context permits
  title Edit again until Archive dispatch. It writes no durable dismissal.
  A successfully added/restored active row or staged candidate removes
  overlay/complete/reopen immediately and reports lost eligibility; merely
  typing an Add draft shows its blocker without changing persisted completion.
  Reopen returns focus to heading/safe Cancel; Cancel returns focus to reopen.
- Switching Scratch before Archive dispatch defers the decision without a
  write and closes only that presentation. Returning in the same page session
  shows complete/reopen if still eligible, never auto-opens. Route exit/reload
  stores no overlay open/Cancel state. Entry/reload onto an already eligible
  Scratch shows complete/reopen; only a new mounted-page false→true transition
  auto-opens.
- Archive rechecks page blockers immediately before dispatch and rechecks
  active lifecycle, exact version, consumed count, unconsumed count, and
  candidate count inside one SCHEMA transaction. It sets only the Scratch
  `archivedAt`/version lifecycle and retains rows for existing Archive View
  restore. It is non-optimistic: the Scratch remains selected/in Pool and the
  overlay remains pending/reconciling until authoritative success. Pending
  locks Cancel/Escape, Undo, Edit, placement, Scratch switch, internal route
  exit, and duplicate Archive.
- Explicit failure leaves the Scratch active and provides manual Retry/Cancel;
  unknown outcome reconciles before any new operation. The approved, validated
  `PendingOperationRecovery` identity descriptor is the only Inbox workflow
  state permitted in `sessionStorage` across forced reload. It is written
  successfully before dispatch or Archive fails closed, contains no draft/
  payload/queue, and clears after terminal reconciliation. Reload resolves to
  archived/removed, not-applied complete/reopen, or unresolved section recovery
  before the initial Inbox projection. `VQ-12` owns unsupported reliability
  realization.
- After confirmed success, preserve current Pool search/sort and select the
  archived row's next-visible then previous-visible Scratch. If a filtered list
  has a visible successor, focus its Selected Scratch Context. If a filtered
  list has no visible result, select no hidden Scratch and focus search
  input/clear.
  If no active Scratch exists without a search filter, show true Inbox empty
  and focus its primary action. Never navigate automatically to Archive View.

### Archive View Surface (rendered for `systemRole: 'archive_view'`)

A **portal, not a container** — archived items keep their original `parentId`; the surface queries all items where `archivedAt` is set (it does not read its own children).

- **Grouping:** by original parent Node (archived L0 Nodes form their own top-level group). **Sort:** `archivedAt` descending within each group. **Search:** filters by title.
- **Restore:** single-item (↩) clears `archivedAt`; BFS auto-placement if the original cell is occupied; restoring a Bit whose parent is archived restores the parent chain (±5s window, Hook 11). Bulk restore is not in v1.
- **Tone:** warm/dignified (distinct from Trash's destructive tone); completed items show ✓.
- **Visual:** existing GridDO baseline UI/tokens in Batch 1 (no dedicated Archive View theme source; future global theme system may affect it via global tokens).

### Direct Archive (context menu)

Any non-system Node or Bit can be archived from its context menu (no Review Mode required) — sets `archivedAt` with cascade (Hook 10). System Nodes are excluded. **Completion does not auto-archive**; completed-but-unarchived items remain in place on the grid until the user archives them.

## Inbox/Triage State Ownership

This lifetime table is normative for the proposed Inbox target. The SCHEMA
[durable/non-durable boundary](SCHEMA.md#durable--non-durable-ownership-boundary)
is authoritative when a state might be mistaken for domain storage.

| Lifetime | Owner and state | End/reset rule |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Durable domain/integrity | Existing Node/Bit/Scratch Breakdown records and approved versions; `StagedCandidate`; archive/consumed lifecycle; narrow `CandidateOrphanAuditEvent` | Repository lifecycle only. Candidate display joins its source; cache miss is never orphan proof. No general operation log, journal, outbox, or offline queue |
| App session (survives same-session Inbox route leave/re-entry, not reload) | `src/stores/triage-store.ts`: last active selected Scratch, Pool expanded/collapsed and per-Scratch manual-reopen exception, Pool query/result/scroll context, Explorer hierarchy path/open columns and column scroll | Validate against current data on re-entry; full reload/new session applies the fallback below |
| Mounted Inbox page session | Add/Edit base snapshots and drafts; one pending intent; deleting/pending/reconciling presentation and operation IDs; Explorer active/interrupted search, result scroll and reveal; placement/type/Result Title state; remote-arrival counts; external-removal transition; completion overlay/Cancel/reopen presentation; proposed `use-triage-newly-placed.ts` markers/pinning/Undo/dependencies | Scratch changes preserve only the states explicitly named in the behavior sections. Inbox route exit clears Explorer search/reveal and Newly Placed/Undo; reload clears all except the Archive recovery identity below |
| Forced-reload recovery identity | SCHEMA `PendingOperationRecovery` in current-tab `sessionStorage`, owned by the Archive operation coordinator | Archive only; written before dispatch, validated on read, cleared after terminal reconcile; no payload, draft, UI cache, mutation queue, or other workflow kind |
| Device-local Inbox preference | Proposed `src/stores/triage-preferences-store.ts`, persisted and validated: Pool created-at sort and Breakdown created-at sort only | Survives route/reload/session; defaults independently to DESC when missing/invalid; never enters content records or future remote data |

Within Inbox/Triage work state, **only Pool sort and Breakdown sort are
device-local persisted preferences**. Existing application-wide theme
preference is not converted into Inbox workflow storage.

Full reload/new app session has one deterministic reset contract:

1. select the first active Scratch under current Pool sort, or `null` if none;
2. start the Pool expanded with no manual-reopen exception;
3. start Grid Explorer at Home with reset column scroll;
4. clear Pool and Explorer current/interrupted queries and results;
5. restore no completion open/Cancel presentation and no unconfirmed placement;
6. restore no Newly Placed marker, pinning, dependency projection, or Undo; and
7. before the initial Inbox projection, reconcile only a valid pending Archive
   descriptor when one exists.

Dark/light, color-theme, or future locale presentation changes are not reset
events. They preserve selected Scratch, Pool/search, drafts/base snapshots,
Explorer path/search/reveal, placement/archive state, operation IDs and pending
flows, and Newly Placed/Undo. They trigger no mutation or navigation and do not
translate user-authored content.

---

## Copy and Localization

Core English Inbox/Triage system copy has one proposed owner:
`src/lib/copy/inbox-triage.ts`. Components consume typed entries for section
identity, actions, validation, lifecycle reasons, statuses, live-region text,
and accessible names instead of adding new distributed string literals. This
module is a target absent from current production, not a claim of an existing
file. It resolves `Q-NAME-04` and is included in File Organization and Key File
Paths.

The core owner does not choose exact wording where a `VQ-*` prerequisite below
reserves it for the user. It may define keys and approved semantic roles while
the dependent value remains blocked. User-authored Scratch/row text and drafts
are never resource strings and are never translated.

Shared locale state/provider, EN/KR resources and toggle, localized date/time,
Korean accessibility/status copy, and Korean theme typography/text-fit QA are
deferred. They must use shared state rather than duplicate routes or reload the
page, and a future locale switch must obey the presentation-preservation
contract above. Cross-surface wrapping, line-count, expansion, and IME visual
detail remain with the separately deferred text-capacity topic.

---

## Inbox/Triage Visual Decision Prerequisites

The selected behavior and lifecycle above remain required. Source absence
does not delete them and does not let SPEC turn behavior prose into a design.
No entry below authorizes layout, appearance, exact copy, iconography,
animation, timing, placement, or per-theme treatment beyond the selected
decision and approved recipe evidence.

### Absent replacement surfaces

Each row is labeled **Decision prerequisite — no automatic fallback**. Its
entry point, controls/state transitions, authority, focus, accessibility, and
lifecycle may be implemented only after the named user decision has a matching
receipt. A nearby Dialog/AlertDialog, editor, global/active-column search body,
card, create form, or surrounding theme chrome is not a fallback.

| ID | Authorized behavior boundary | Required focus/accessibility boundary | Status |
|----|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------|
| `VQ-01` | External archive/delete of selected Scratch enters the five-second move/pause/resume/no-Cancel transition, revalidates visible destination, supports source-separated full-draft copy, and cancels only on authoritative archive restore | Announce lifecycle/timing once, not each tick; pause is a stable initial action; copy status preserves focus; stale work stays locked | **Decision prerequisite — no automatic fallback**: user owns replacement surface, wording, layout, appearance, icons, timing treatment, and theme realization |
| `VQ-03` | Scratch/route departure with a non-empty Add draft offers continue-writing or discard-and-move after any required inline Save; it neither auto-Adds nor queues intents | Continue returns logical focus to Add; discard performs the original action once; native unload remains browser-exit only | **Decision prerequisite — no automatic fallback**: user owns app-internal confirmation realization and copy |
| `VQ-04` | Scratch-title and row-content editors remain inline in their source surfaces across validation, saving, offline, retry, conflict/use-mine/use-latest, lifecycle invalidation, draft review/copy, Save, Cancel, Escape, and valid blur | Preserve editor/draft and logical focus through nonterminal states; never open generic/global conflict UI or steal IME focus; invalid source uses deterministic next-row/Add fallback | **Decision prerequisite — no automatic fallback**: user owns the complete inline replacement surfaces and content realization |
| `VQ-07` | Opening dedicated full-hierarchy Explorer search replaces only the Explorer body; it owns pre-search/results/loading/stale/error/duplicates/reveal/Undo feedback and DnD interruption, while global search stays separate | Input/results support arrows, Enter, Escape; removed focused result returns to input; selection rebuilds path inside Inbox; result rows are not DnD sources | **Decision prerequisite — no automatic fallback**: user owns the complete replacement search body; active-column/global search and ordinary columns are prohibited substitutes |
| `VQ-09` | Over-limit staged placement uses Result Title before confirmation; direct length gates expose allowed/unavailable type reasons and Cancel with no direct editor or truncation | Result Title starts at its input; unavailable types expose accessible reason; Cancel returns to source | **Decision prerequisite — no automatic fallback**: user owns Result Title and direct-limit surfaces; create dialogs and generic placement UI are prohibited substitutes |

### Existing-surface state gaps

These gaps may use only the approved shared semantic-state envelope: state
attributes, existing semantic/theme tokens, visible text or icon/non-color
cues, and the selected focus/accessibility contract. Exact effect, duration,
wording, placement, layout, and per-theme values remain named user-owned
Decision prerequisites before the dependent UI task.

| ID | Trigger and semantic states | Allowed action/focus/accessibility contract | Remaining Decision prerequisite |
|----|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `VQ-02` | Authoritative Add or Unstage success produces one non-repeating success state; reduced motion replaces movement/sparkle with static distinction | Add keeps input focus; Unstage restores source focus; both announce politely without focus theft | Exact effect, duration, wording, placement, and per-theme realization |
| `VQ-05` | Add pending/failure/reconcile and Delete in-place deleting/failure/check-again remain distinct; success is shown only after authority | Pending locks only conflicting actions; draft/row remains; Delete success/failure/check-again uses the deterministic focus rules in Breakdown | Exact state treatment, copy, action placement, timing, and per-theme realization |
| `VQ-06` | Pool hidden-selection; Staging pending/invalid/remote-arrival/orphan/stale/failure; and Explorer remote/path states retain their distinct triggers and allowed actions | Never steal focus for remote/status arrival; use polite live status or alert semantics as selected; vanished source/path uses named safe focus fallback | Exact treatments, wording, indicator/alert placement, duration/dismissal appearance, and per-theme realization for each family |
| `VQ-08` | Placement pending, explicit failure, unknown/reconciling, stale source/target, authoritative success, and Retry/Cancel states preserve the same operation/source/affordance | Contain focus in the active step; failure focuses Retry, stale/validation retains current-step focus, success focuses actual card | Exact status effect, copy, control placement, layout, timing, and per-theme realization |
| `VQ-10` | Selected+newly overlap, Undo available/ineligible/dependency-reenabled, undoing, failure, retry, and conflict remain separate from marker provenance | Accessible non-color reason is available without hover; pending keeps card; post-Undo Grid/search focus and restoration announcement follow the named rules; repeated motion is forbidden | Exact marker/overlap/control/reason/status treatment, copy, placement, timing, and per-theme realization |
| `VQ-11` | Non-empty Add draft or title-editor lifecycle blocks completion presentation; eligibility loss withdraws overlay/complete/reopen and reports why | Blocker keeps draft/editor and logical focus; no auto-submit/save; restored work remains reachable | Exact blocker/withdrawal copy, effect, placement, layout, and per-theme realization |
| `VQ-12` | Archive pending, explicit failure, unknown/reconciling, forced-reload recovery, check-again, Retry/Cancel, and authoritative success are distinct variants of the selected Breakdown-scoped flow | Pending/recovery keeps a stable focus target in the section; failure focuses Retry; success focuses the verified visible-order destination | Exact treatment, wording, control/status placement, layout, timing, and per-theme realization |

### Preserved deferrals and exclusions

- No prototype mock mutation, route duplication, review control, internal staged
  handle, Scratch-switch marker reset, or local completion latch is promoted.
- No repeated pulse/blink/flicker, keyboard placement, hidden placement command,
  BitCard redesign, Korean UI, Neumorphism water-lens polish, cross-surface
  text/IME design, or toast migration is included.
- Common BitCard eight-theme redesign and later Staging/placed-card reuse remain
  deferred; current cards are only the core actual-record foundation.
- All approved recipe evidence remains source-only. SPEC claims no rendered
  verification, screenshot, contrast, depth, clipping, motion, responsive, or
  per-theme outcome.

## Responsive Breakpoints

> GridDO is **web-first, desktop-focused** for v1. Responsive design is deferred (see PRD Section 26). Tailwind default breakpoints are configured but not actively designed for. Minimum supported width: 1024px.

| Token | Width | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `sm` | 640px | Not targeted for v1 |
| `md` | 768px | Not targeted for v1 |
| `lg` | 1024px | Minimum supported width. Full grid visible. Sidebar open by default |
| `xl` | 1280px | Comfortable grid spacing. Default development target |
| `2xl` | 1536px | Extra grid spacing, larger day columns in Calendar |

## Phase 9 PRD Departures

Intentional departures from the PRD introduced in Phase 9. Each is a deliberate design decision, not an omission.

| # | PRD Rule | Phase 9 Change | Reason |
|---|----------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Sidebar is foldable; when folded, no icon strip (Section 16) | Permanent narrow icon rail (`w-12`), always visible, no fold/unfold | Reduces cognitive overhead; all functions always one click away |
| 2 | Drag-to-reposition and drag-onto-Node are edit-mode-only (Sections 17, 20) | Grid DnD enabled outside edit mode; breadcrumb drops remain edit-mode-only | Repositioning is a frequent action; gating behind edit mode adds friction |
| 3 | Deeper levels apply vignette effect (Section 5) | Vignette removed; background color changes per level instead (`--grid-bg-l0` through `--grid-bg-l3`) | Background color is a stronger, more immediate depth signal |
| 4 | Trash icon available on Level 0 only (Section 19) | Trash icon visible on all levels | Sidebar is identical across all levels for consistency |
