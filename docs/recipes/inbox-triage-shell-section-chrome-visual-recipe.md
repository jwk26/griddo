> Status: **Proposed — recipe-package user gate pending**
> Verification: **source-only; no rendered route/state was checked**
> Production owner: `TriageWorkspace` plus shared Inbox/Triage theme realization (`LAND-THEME`)

- Shared values: Design Source `src/app/themes.css:1-439`. That file has no selected GridDO override block; absent GridDO values must not be reconstructed.

The prototype is Design Source only. Its routes, local state, handlers, copy, and duplicated component structure are not production authority.

## Shared Adopted Contract

- Preserve the four semantic areas: Scratch Pool, Breakdown, Staging, and Grid Explorer.
- Preserve main-work vertical `60/40`, Breakdown/Staging horizontal `60/40`, and Staging Node/Bit `35/65`. A route-local ratio that differs is observation, not adoption.
- Restore visible section identity as theme chrome. The semantic names remain `Scratch Pool`, `Breakdown`, `Staging`, and `Grid Explorer`; only Tiny Desk `Library Index`, Retro Mac `Finder`, and Terminal `GRID EXPLORER` are approved alternate Grid labels.
- Preserve internal scrolling while hiding scrollbar chrome on the Pool list, Breakdown list, both Staging subsections, and every Explorer column.
- Keep one information and interaction contract. Theme differences flow through semantic attributes, variables/classes, or theme-realization components, never theme-ID branches in product components.
- Section chrome does not authorize an unsupported replacement body. In particular it is not a fallback for `VQ-01/03/04/07/09`.

## Shared Token Implications

- Retain the existing core/page/grid/font/shape/depth variable groups and add Inbox/Triage surface roles only after canonical approval.
- A section surface needs semantic roles for shell background, section header, section divider, internal scroll viewport, and section-local state overlay.
- Existing-surface gaps may use the approved shared state envelope: semantic state attributes, existing semantic/theme tokens, visible text or icon/non-color cues, and the selected accessibility/focus contract. This does not authorize exact effect, duration, copy, placement, layout, or per-theme values.
- Source motion declarations are observations only. No duration, easing, delay, keyframe, interruption, retrigger, or reduced-motion equivalence is adopted here.

## Theme Realizations

### GridDO

- Observed source-only: the shell declares `gap-4`; upper work uses `flex-[6]` with Breakdown `flex-[6]` and Staging `flex-[4]`; the lower Explorer is `flex-[4]`. Panels use card/background/border semantics and Explorer columns use a one-pixel border grid (`gap-[1px] bg-border p-[1px]`).
- Adopted fact: polished product/dashboard section framing and blue technical state accents are the GridDO visual language.
- Token implication: consume current GridDO semantic card/border/primary values. No missing exact GridDO theme value is inferred from prose or another theme.

### Tiny Desk

- Observed source-only: the shell declares `gap-4`; Pool is a wood `DeskPanel`, Staging is cork, and other sections use paper/desk panels. `themes.css:1-46` declares Playfair, `8px` radius, `3px` border, and offset shadows `2px 2px 5px` / `4px 4px 10px` with light/dark variants.
- Adopted fact: wood, cork, paper, and stationery may distinguish section roles while keeping the shared layout.
- Token implication: use shared Tiny Desk variables for the base; surface-specific wood/cork/paper roles require semantic aliases rather than route markup reuse.

### Neumorphism

- Observed source-only: `SoftPanel` surfaces use `gap-5`; the upper layout is `grid-cols-[3fr_2fr]`; rounded panels consume inset/card shadow variables. `themes.css:47-112` declares Inter, `20px`, zero border, paired light/dark extrusion shadows, and named inset/card shadow variants.
- Adopted fact: raised and inset soft-plate declarations carry section hierarchy without adding hard section borders.
- Token implication: preserve the selected shadow variable family; do not claim rendered depth or contrast until checked.

### Claymorphism

- Observed source-only: the shell uses `gap-6`; panels are large rounded clay surfaces; Staging and Explorer consume `--clay-staging-bg` and `--clay-hierarchy-bg`. `themes.css:113-253` declares Inter, `32px`, zero border, outer+inset shadow strings, panel backgrounds, and light/dark button/card roles.
- Adopted fact: puffy tactile panels and distinct clay wells may express section ownership.
- Token implication: promote reusable clay panel/well roles, not literal per-component colors in JSX.

### Origami

- Observed source-only: `PaperPanel` uses per-section intensity and folded corners; the shell uses `gap-4`; dashed dividers and faceted radii recur. `themes.css:254-297` declares Space Mono, asymmetric `2px 12px 2px 12px / 12px 2px 12px 2px`, `1px` border, and folded-paper shadow strings.
- Adopted fact: folded/faceted paper geometry may differentiate section frames.
- Token implication: corner/fold geometry needs recipe-owned surface roles; keyboard-grab UI and pulse declarations inside the route are excluded.

### Terminal

- Observed source-only: the shell uses `gap-4`; `TerminalPanel` provides framed console regions and the Explorer header reads `GRID EXPLORER`. `themes.css:298-347` declares VT323, zero radius, `2px` border, no base shadow, and a `0 0 15px` theme-color hover glow.
- Adopted fact: console frames, dense mono labels, and uppercase identity may realize the shared sections.
- Token implication: light/dark foreground changes must remain variable-driven; rendered contrast is unverified.

### Retro Mac

- Observed source-only: the shell uses `gap-4`; `MacWindow`/striped title bars frame sections, and the Explorer is `Finder`. `themes.css:348-395` declares Space Mono, `4px`, `2px` border, and hard `2px 2px 0` / `4px 4px 0` shadows in black or white.
- Adopted fact: 1-bit window chrome and hard-offset controls may realize section identity.
- Token implication: stripe/title-bar and hard-shadow roles belong in theme CSS, not copied inline styles.

### Graphite

- Observed source-only: the shell uses `gap-6`; dark, subtle, and white `GraphitePanel` variants separate Pool, Staging, and work surfaces. `themes.css:396-439` declares Inter, `8px`, `2px` border, and restrained vertical shadows `0 4px 10px` / `0 8px 20px` with light/dark variants.
- Adopted fact: thin drafting lines, grayscale fields, and restrained editorial chrome may distinguish sections.
- Token implication: dark/subtle panel roles need semantic aliases; no literal route duplication is adopted.

## Exclusions And Verification

- Excluded: route duplication, inline mock architecture, review controls, focus-collapse handlers, internal staging handles, keyboard-grab mechanics, repeated pulse/blink, and route-local mutations.
- Source inspection confirms declarations and structure only. It does not verify contrast, depth, layering, clipping, overflow, rasterized geometry, scrolling, responsive behavior, motion, light/dark parity, or any combined outcome.
- Declared review context is a populated workspace at `1920x1080`; it was not rendered in this pass.
