## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Open | Identified and unresolved |
| In Progress | Actively owned by the current task |
| Awaiting User Decision | Blocked on an explicit user-owned choice |
| Closed | Resolved with durable evidence |
| Deferred | Moved to declared future ownership with rationale |
| Dropped | Explicitly rejected or no longer applicable |
| Promoted to Execution Plan | Reflected in canonical task ownership |

## Gate C Kickoff

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Gate | `gate-c`, explicitly approved by the user on 2026-08-28 with statement `내 승인합니다` |
| Phase scope | Phase 29, Tasks 155–158, equal-weight product and workflow-audit tracks |
| First bounded batch | Task 155 only; sequential execution; Tasks 156–158 held for fresh dependency/readiness recheck |
| Task state | Tasks 155–158 remain `[ ]`; Task 155 product work and audit measurement have not started |
| Source mode | Merged canonical Phase 29 plan plus accepted Task 123/152 foundations, approved nine-recipe package and DP-VQ10 receipt, and unchanged-candidate Track B audit continuity |
| Integration | `origin/main` at `f3c2be6b2afa2da51cde39d22c13eabf2286f296`, local divergence `0/0` after fetch |
| Approved base | `f3c2be6b2afa2da51cde39d22c13eabf2286f296`; no base exception |
| Feature branch | `phase-29/mounted-page-newly-placed-undo` |
| Worktree choice | New linked feature worktree at `/Users/jwk/Documents/griddo2-codex-phase-29-mounted-page-newly-placed-undo`; no reuse |
| Whole-file receipt | `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_29.gate-c.json` |
| Next legal action | After a green receipt-only commit and Control Tower acceptance, use the pinned candidate `$run-task` in a fresh session for Task 155 only |

## Readiness And Clean-Start Evidence

- The synchronized Adapter resolver returned `approval_required`,
  `contract_ready=true`, and `writes_allowed=false` before Gate C. The user's
  exact Gate C disposition is the write authority.
- The pinned workflow candidate is clean on branch
  `post-v1/workflow-candidate-low-cost` at
  `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49`. The Adapter blob is
  `7903892c04c4eb6fcd694712d5a01fdb608e183f`. Both remain read-only.
- Immediately before mutation, integration `HEAD` and `origin/main` both
  equaled the approved base, the integration tree was clean with divergence
  `0/0`, and the approved feature branch and worktree path were absent.
- Immediately after worktree creation, `HEAD` equaled the approved base, the
  tree was clean, and `approved-base..HEAD` contained zero commits.
- Task 155 dependencies Tasks 123 and 152 are `[x]`, Accepted. Their
  implementation, checkpoint, and acceptance commits are ancestors of the
  approved base.
- The Task 152 mounted Workspace callback exposes stable result/type,
  operation/result IDs, source/candidate versions, and destination/path
  provenance. The Task 155 hook/test/evidence files are correctly absent, and
  the named Workspace, Explorer, NodeCard, BitCard, placement hook, and test
  owners exist. No blocking plan/code drift was found.
- The leaf Newly/Undo recipe's historical `Proposed` header is a resolved
  false blocker: the nine-recipe package is approved at `7a1545126bab755184adf356dcca761c8db74a43`,
  the current recipe index says `User-approved production recipe package`, and
  DP-VQ10 receipt blob `401b8d84ee95d4c09b1466c9a7800e2b39e33599`
  is accepted by Task 117 commit `d4bd591aa3e0cdd540156c95f306c274c215ca26`.

## Baseline Full Gate

- Dependency setup: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` exited 0 in `3.43s`;
  the lockfile was unchanged and 537 packages were linked. Tracked state
  remained clean.
- The Adapter-declared full gate ran serially at the exact approved base:

| Command | Exit | Elapsed | Relevant result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `pnpm test` | 0 | `29.47s` | 98 test files and 1,146 tests passed; Vitest duration `27.91s`; Node emitted the existing `module.register()` deprecation and worker `localStorage` experimental warnings |
| `pnpm lint` | 0 | `7.56s` | 0 errors; 11 existing warnings |
| `pnpm typecheck` | 0 | `4.09s` | `tsc --noEmit` passed |
| `pnpm build` | 0 | `12.39s` | Next.js 16.2.1 production build passed; compile `5.1s`, TypeScript `4.0s`, seven pages generated; existing Node deprecation and `localStorage` experimental warnings were emitted |

No production or test implementation, Task 155 measurement row, relevant-input
fingerprint, downstream lifecycle, push, publication, integration, or cleanup
occurred during kickoff.

## Active Issues

No Phase 29 product issue is active at kickoff. The nine carried post-close
workflow findings are owned without verdict by
`docs/verification/inbox-triage/phase-29-workflow-pilot-audit.md`.

## Task 155 Handoff

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `155 — Project Newly Placed provenance over actual cards` |
| State | `[ ]`, unstarted; no product/test file changed and no Task 155 audit row or fingerprint exists |
| Dependencies | Tasks 123 and 152 are `[x]`, Accepted and contained in the approved base |
| Scope | The exact existing Task 155 contract in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; no Task 156–158 scope |
| Audit invariant | The implementation checkpoint is incomplete until product evidence and the actual Task 155 audit measurement row are committed together; acceptance-only work does not edit the audit |
| Next action | Control Tower reviews the committed Gate C receipt, then a fresh session invokes only the pinned candidate `run-task` for Task 155 |
