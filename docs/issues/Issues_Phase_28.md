## Readiness And Clean-Start Evidence

- The pinned workflow candidate is branch
  `post-v1/workflow-candidate-low-cost` at
  `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49`. Global lifecycle skills under
  `/Users/jwk/Documents/codex-workflow/skills/**` were not used.
- Before approval, the synchronized Adapter v2 resolver returned
  `approval_required`, `contract_ready=true`, and `writes_allowed=false`.
- After `git fetch origin`, local `main` and `origin/main` both resolved to the
  approved base with divergence `0/0`; Phase 27 receipt B and merge commit are
  contained, and `origin/main:src` is
  `7b831a941d40631c2212d07a010f3c6b4a00e01a`.
- All accepted prerequisites for Tasks 149–154 and the approved
  `DP-VQ06-EXPLORER`, `DP-VQ07`, `DP-VQ08`, and `DP-VQ09` receipts are
  contained in the approved base. Tasks 152–154 remain subject to their
  in-phase dependency rechecks.
- Task 149's named DnD, Explorer, Workspace, and test owners exist. Existing
  `autoScroll={false}` is a preserved condition; release-time DOM hit testing
  and valid-column edge scrolling remain unimplemented as planned. No blocking
  plan/code drift or active issue applies to the first batch.
- Immediately after worktree creation, `HEAD` equaled the approved base, the
  tree was clean, and `approved-base..HEAD` contained zero commits.

## Baseline Full Gate

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` exited 0; the lockfile was unchanged and
  537 packages were linked.
- The Adapter full gate ran serially:

| Command | Exit | Relevant result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `pnpm test` | 0 | 95 test files and 982 tests passed |
| `pnpm lint` | 0 | 0 errors; 11 pre-existing warnings |
| `pnpm typecheck` | 0 | `tsc --noEmit` passed |
| `pnpm build` | 0 | Next.js 16.2.1 production build passed; seven routes generated |

No production implementation or Task 149 execution occurred.

## Workflow-Cost Pilot Handoff

- External baseline:
  `/Users/jwk/Documents/GridDO_Codex_Workflow_Phase_28_Audit.md`, SHA-256
  `13c47986ebbb9c3b098943132cb61b1fd9355476c86a7969fab70d61a5a33fda`.
- Approved tracked target:
  `docs/verification/inbox-triage/phase-28-workflow-pilot-audit.md`.
- This `run-phase` lifecycle did not copy or promote the external audit. A
  fresh Task 149 `$run-task` session owns the exact verified baseline copy in
  a baseline-only documentation commit after validating the green kickoff
  receipt and before production/test changes.
- Each Task 149–154 `$run-task` writer, or an explicitly approved repair
  writer, owns its compact measured experiment row at the corresponding task
  or cluster checkpoint. Estimates must not be recorded as measured facts.
- Phase 28 `$end-phase` may finalize measured findings and the handoff manifest
  only. Candidate skill or Adapter changes require a separate post-publication
  lifecycle and explicit user approval.

## Active Issues

| ID | State | Evidence | User disposition | Canonical impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P28-04` | `Promoted to Execution Plan` | Task 150 owner discovery found that the existing per-parent active snapshots could not distinguish deleted/archived/moved/unreachable causes or initial/local/moved provenance; the local placement result identity stopped inside `use-dnd.ts`/Workspace; and the selected-Bit/reveal production owner does not exist until Task 151. Checkpoint review found stale `Task 150 only` current-edge declarations in the VQ Gate Register, Executable DP Receipt Edges, and completed Task 113 section; a subsequent evidence check found Task 113's Verification sentence still stated an unqualified Task-150-only release. Detailed evidence is in `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-150.md`. | On 2026-08-24 the user approved: one new dedicated reactive Explorer provenance hook and direct test; the minimum existing DnD/Workspace producer handoff and direct tests for the created stable result identity; no placement semantic change; and movement of only selected-Bit disappearance realization to Task 151's existing reveal owner. On 2026-08-25 the user authorized both targeted docs-only repairs: first the three stale edge declarations, then the remaining Task 113 Verification qualifier. Search realization and all other Task 151 behavior remain unstarted. | `Reflected` in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` at the VQ-06 Gate Register row, `DP-VQ06-EXPLORER` Executable DP Receipt Edge, completed Task 113 historical/current supersession and Verification text, and the exact Task 150/151 contracts. The historical JSON receipt and its 2026-08-10 Task-150-only acceptance remain unchanged; `P28-04` corrects only the current selected-Bit disappearance edge. |

Phase 27 items `P27-06` and `P27-08` remain Deferred under their Phase 27 owner
and are outside Phase 28 scope.

## Task 154 Durable Start

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `154 — Render DP-VQ09 Result Title and direct-limit surfaces` |
| State | `Implemented; awaiting user review/acceptance`; Task 154 remains `[ ]`; the bounded `P28-09` repair is complete |
| Approval | Exact fresh candidate-pinned Task 154 work order on 2026-08-26, bounded by `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_28.gate-c.json`, accepted `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_24.Task_116.dp-vq09.json`, and the exact current Task 154 contract; explicit same-session `P28-07` approval adds only the two existing Workspace owner/test paths, and explicit same-session `P28-08` approval adds only the existing Scratch-breakdown hook/test readiness owner paths recorded below |
| Approved base / entrypoint | Integration base `8cb2d904a55c136ca319e7bdf619d8e5d962fce8`; Task 154 entrypoint and recovery anchor `29bab4fe0ea2d0abcc837b070161ec0ea1ea5b4a`; accepted Task 153 `src` tree `bcdcc5f2ed9c5ece9780a6f5ea0ccf261d5044a5` |
| Exact scope | Modify only the approved placement hook/test, Explorer/test, global CSS, inbox-triage copy/test, the `P28-07`-approved Workspace/direct mounted test owners, and the `P28-08`-approved Scratch-breakdown hook/test readiness owner; the Workspace delta remains limited to authoritative source/candidate projection, no-write invalidation wiring, once-only announcement, and the existing safe focus fallback proof; the Scratch-breakdown delta is limited to a read-only current-snapshot `isReady` projection and direct test, with no other hook behavior change; create `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-154.md`; update only this ledger state and the actual measured Task 154 workflow-pilot row |
| Behavior | Realize the accepted staged over-limit Result Title and direct Node/Bit availability steps inside Task 152's captured Placement Affordance; exact limits, copy, validation, Continue/Cancel, focus, snapshot preservation, no-write invalidation, static reduced-motion parity, and all eight theme mappings; no source truncation/mutation, direct editor, automatic fallback, or later-task behavior |
| Dependencies | Tasks 116, 128, and 152 are `[x]`, Accepted; `DP-VQ09=A` is accepted and released for Task 154 only; no unresolved Task 154 prerequisite |
| Issues / deviations | `P28-07`, `P28-08`, and `P28-09` — Closed. The one approved `P28-09` cycle bound suppression to the successful callback result and added exactly the three locked-state regressions; final High-risk review found no remaining Critical or Important issue. No owner or product-meaning expansion occurred. Closed `P28-06` remains unchanged. |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` for closed `P28-07` and `P28-08`; `None` for closed `P28-09`, which changes no current contract owner or product meaning. The accepted `DP-VQ09` product meaning and receipt are unchanged. |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean committed Task 154 implementation checkpoint and await explicit user review/acceptance. Keep Task 154 `[ ]`; do not push, publish, integrate, clean up, or start another task. |

### Task 154 Owner-Discovery Blocker

| ID | State | Evidence | Exact minimum choices | Canonical impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P28-07` | `Closed` | `src/hooks/use-triage-placement.ts` owns a frozen release snapshot and only `invalidate(dropId)`; `src/components/triage/hierarchy-explorer.tsx` detects target/path disappearance only. The authoritative staged candidate/source projection, once-only placement alert, direct Breakdown-grip fallback, and staged candidate/Staging-heading fallback are all in `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx`. Detailed discovery evidence is in `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-154.md`. | On 2026-08-26 the user explicitly approved only `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx` plus `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.test.tsx` as Task 154 owners for authoritative source/candidate projection, no-write invalidation wiring, once-only announcement, and mounted proof of the existing safe focus fallbacks. Hidden state, custom DOM events, direct DataStore subscription, other Workspace behavior/owners, and product-semantic changes remain prohibited. | `Reflected` in the current Task 154 file/action contract in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; accepted `DP-VQ09` receipt, recipe, and design authority are unchanged. |
| `P28-08` | `Closed` | Post-focused-gate High-risk review found a concrete direct-placement race: `useScratchBreakdowns` returns `breakdowns: []` both before its first live-query snapshot and for an authoritative empty result, while Workspace currently invalidates on absence. A valid mounted source can therefore be falsely closed before the added Workspace hook instance becomes ready. Timing heuristics, hidden state, direct DataStore subscription, or a second DOM/event channel are prohibited and cannot prove authoritative absence. The same review also found two in-scope repairs: edited Result Title reliability copy/source-truth separation, and target/path invalidation once-only source focus/announcement. Evidence and current checks are recorded in `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-154.md`. | On 2026-08-26 the user explicitly approved only `src/hooks/use-scratch-breakdowns.ts` and `src/hooks/use-scratch-breakdowns.test.tsx` as Task 154 owners for a read-only `isReady` projection derived from the existing current selected-Scratch live-query snapshot: false before the first current snapshot and true after it, including authoritative empty. Query, editor, command, DataStore, persistence, schema, and all other Breakdown behavior remain prohibited. The same approval authorizes repair cycle 3 for the three recorded review findings inside the existing paths. | `Reflected` in the current Task 154 file/action contract in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; accepted `DP-VQ09`, its receipt, recipe, and design authority are unchanged. |
| `P28-09` | `Closed` | Repair cycle 3 exposed the locked-state regression. The approved fourth cycle made Workspace report successful pre-dispatch close/replacement and bound Explorer suppression to that exact stale presentation. The former props-derived condition reproduced RED; final focused 5 files/179 tests and full 98 files/1124 tests passed. Exactly three locked-state regressions retain the live status for `pending`, `unknown`, and `reconciling`; final High-risk review found no Critical or Important issue. | On 2026-08-26 the user approved exactly one additional repair cycle with the recorded hypothesis: keep the current callback boundary but return whether Workspace actually closed and emitted the Task 154 replacement announcement; suppress Explorer live semantics only on that successful pre-dispatch result, and retain the existing live stale-placement status when locked cancellation is refused. Add exactly pending/unknown/reconciling target-loss regression tests. No owner, receipt, design, copy, persistence, command, or product-scope expansion. | `None`; current contract already owns both affected Explorer/Workspace paths and accepted `DP-VQ09` meaning is unchanged. |

## Task 153 Durable Start

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `153 — Render DP-VQ08 placement reliability states` |
| State | Accepted by the user on 2026-08-26 at checkpoint `8110c6e499b6d9c5c3c96c17142534430b2f7bed`; implementation `b73dc2505c30a132e7d9fbbfcd02bf09a2aef188`; accepted `src` tree `bcdcc5f2ed9c5ece9780a6f5ea0ccf261d5044a5`; fingerprint `df60d40a5beb3d130d1446a32ca6cd8c4743a50f601cecdbcd4357359ca07ee8`; Task 153 is `[x]`; Task 154 remains `[ ]`, unstarted |
| Approval | Exact fresh candidate-pinned Task 153 work order on 2026-08-26, bounded by `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_28.gate-c.json`, accepted `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_24.Task_115.dp-vq08.json`, and the exact current Task 153 contract |
| Approved base / entrypoint | Integration base `8cb2d904a55c136ca319e7bdf619d8e5d962fce8`; Task 153 entrypoint and recovery anchor `12fd2a9dedd282a784e0f9113950cb1a7646477c`; accepted Task 152 `src` tree `8247077665a212e575faad44f20046de623b7306` |
| Exact scope | Modify only the approved placement hook/test, Explorer/test, global CSS, and inbox-triage copy/test owners; create `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-153.md`; update only this ledger state and the actual measured Task 153 workflow-pilot row |
| Behavior | Realize the accepted fixed reliability rail inside Task 152's captured affordance for pending, unknown, reconciling, authoritative not-applied, stale source, stale target, and authoritative success; exact receipt-owned copy/actions/focus; same-operation read-only Check again; same logical operation/result ID Retry; retained truth and operation-owned lifetime; polite atomic static status; reduced-motion parity and eight-theme mapping |
| Dependencies | Tasks 115, 128, and 152 are `[x]`, Accepted; `DP-VQ08=A` is accepted for Task 153 only; no unresolved Task 153 prerequisite |
| Issues / deviations | `P28-06` — Closed. The explicitly approved fourth bounded repair was accepted with canonical impact `None`. |
| Canonical impact | `None` — Task 153 implements the existing approved contract without changing canonical product, design, policy, data, persistence, command, or lifecycle authority |
| Next legal action | Task 153 acceptance-only transaction is complete; Task 154 remains unstarted and requires its own exact lifecycle authority |

### Task 153 Repair Budget Stop

| ID | State | Evidence | Exact minimum repair hypothesis | Canonical impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P28-06` | `Closed` | Initial RED: 13 expected failures with 61/74 passing. Repairs one through three reached 72/74, then 73/74 with a lint error, then 69/74 at durable stop `7c7a6857d43c68db42f6382f601007c004d576b1`. After explicit fourth-cycle approval, the exact semantic-neutral live-region repair passed 74/74 focused tests and the latest full gate: 98 files / 1086 tests, lint 0 errors, typecheck, and build. Implementation is `b73dc2505c30a132e7d9fbbfcd02bf09a2aef188`; detailed evidence is in `task-153.md`. | The user accepted checkpoint `8110c6e499b6d9c5c3c96c17142534430b2f7bed` on 2026-08-26 and closed `P28-06`; no additional owner, scope, or product decision was required. | `None` — implementation-local accessibility/test-integration repair to the accepted DP-VQ08 success-announcement contract. |

## Task 152 Accepted Checkpoint

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `152 — Connect direct/staged placement selection and confirmation` |

| Approval | Exact fresh candidate-pinned Task 152 run-task work order on 2026-08-26, bounded by `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_28.gate-c.json` and the exact current Task 152 contract |
| Approved base / entrypoint | Integration base `8cb2d904a55c136ca319e7bdf619d8e5d962fce8`; feature entrypoint and recovery anchor `0ab994e867754db96d64c34691942d27cf9c8efc`; accepted Task 151 `src` tree `8d80becbfb821d54453939b81e20c249a4fb2a1a` |
| User disposition | Control Tower authorized acceptance on 2026-08-26 of checkpoint `e25b1ebe0275d8a7ff16c612195b11780da98b21`, implementation commit `7ba936147722e1e8ebb4a3fb6b9bceed9a65ca88`, accepted `src` tree `8247077665a212e575faad44f20046de623b7306`, relevant-input fingerprint `424a4e6436a5de33ef2f033293129c172660b0769fda68d419cd64894f4e2db2`, and `P28-05` as repaired with canonical impact `None` |
| Exact scope | Create the placement coordinator hook/test and Task 152 verification record; modify only the approved DnD, Explorer, Workspace, and owner tests; extend the shared operation-lock test; update only this ledger state and the actual measured Task 152 workflow-pilot row |
| Behavior | Staged release target; direct Node/Bit type plus destination/path selection; distinct target-column confirmation; exact source/target/version snapshot; explicit Confirm/Cancel and focus return; shared `placement` lock; one Task 123 dispatch; pending/unknown/reconciling lock retention; duplicate/competing-intent rejection without queue/replay; terminal-only release; full-target reason with disabled Confirm and working Cancel; Task 135 search close/lock coordination; valid/invalid/stale/moved/no-write and unknown reconciliation; Drop-only no-write |
| Dependencies | Tasks 123, 128, 134, 135, 136, 139, 145, and 149 are `[x]`, Accepted; no unresolved Task 152 prerequisite |
| Issues / deviations | Four bounded implementation-local repair cycles. The user explicitly approved the fourth cycle after durable `P28-05` review evidence; its mounted RED reproduced focus loss when the authoritative card rendered after five RAF callbacks, and the existing Explorer owner now retains a render-driven exact typed-identity one-shot focus intent. No scope or canonical deviation. The stale plan header/Phase Index aggregate remains explicitly excluded from silent Task 152 repair and was not an affected readiness blocker |
| Canonical impact | `None` — Task 152 implements the existing approved contract without changing canonical product, design, policy, data, persistence, or lifecycle authority |
| Implementation / verification | Implementation commit `7ba936147722e1e8ebb4a3fb6b9bceed9a65ca88`; `src` tree `8247077665a212e575faad44f20046de623b7306`; exact latest-input fingerprint `424a4e6436a5de33ef2f033293129c172660b0769fda68d419cd64894f4e2db2`. Focused gate 5 files / 182 tests; full gate 98 files / 1075 tests; lint 0 errors with 11 unchanged warnings; typecheck/build/diff check passed. Detailed evidence: `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-152.md` |
| Review | Final sole-session High-risk review found no remaining Critical, Important, or Minor issue in the bounded nine-path product/test diff |
| Next legal action | Return the clean committed Task 152 acceptance-only checkpoint to Control Tower; Tasks 153–154 remain `[ ]`, unstarted |

### Task 152 Review Blockers

| ID | State | Evidence | Exact minimum repair hypothesis | Canonical impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P28-05` | `Closed` | The user accepted checkpoint `e25b1ebe0275d8a7ff16c612195b11780da98b21` and the fourth-cycle repair. The mounted regression exhausted the former five-frame window, rendered the authoritative result afterward, and failed with focus on `body`; the accepted implementation focuses the exact typed card through grid-render-driven identity matching with no timer or retry budget. Durable details and the accepted fingerprint are in `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-152.md`. | Accepted as repaired on 2026-08-26; no further repair hypothesis is open. | `None` — implementation-local focus/lifecycle correction to the existing Task 152 contract. |

## Task 151 Accepted Checkpoint

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `151 — Render DP-VQ07 dedicated Explorer search body and close semantics` |
| State | `Accepted`; Task 151 `[x]`; Tasks 152–154 remain unstarted |
| Approval | Exact fresh candidate-pinned Task 151 run-task work order on 2026-08-26, bounded by `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_28.gate-c.json`, accepted `DP-VQ07`, and only the `P28-04`-moved `DP-VQ06-EXPLORER` selected-Bit disappearance slice; targeted rejection of checkpoint `cb92805` followed by explicit approval of a fourth bounded repair limited to path-intent invalidation, Explorer-external Escape clearing, and native list/listitem result semantics |
| Start base / recovery anchor | Initial base `b13bcf0964d7113d7fcf701f3476f055fa818789`; third-repair recovery anchor `7ff75b1bd167de124c303cc487ecbe7c9f1237d3`; fourth-repair recovery anchor `cb9280534f1f502973e5bd762a7e254331809a04`; accepted implementation checkpoint `11a84c776700d33b5fa3f6323528e3e82e3a5fac`; implementation commit `c2749b6f3b0a60cba6d6fbb3c7ff921936446925`; accepted `src` tree `8d80becbfb821d54453939b81e20c249a4fb2a1a`; accepted Task 150 `src` tree `73a1d973263f92d97580927063f27651482d18d3` |
| User disposition | On 2026-08-26 the user accepted the exact Task 151 implementation checkpoint `11a84c776700d33b5fa3f6323528e3e82e3a5fac`, implementation commit `c2749b6f3b0a60cba6d6fbb3c7ff921936446925`, and actual `src` tree `8d80becbfb821d54453939b81e20c249a4fb2a1a`; no Critical, Important, or Minor finding remained |
| Exact scope | Create the dedicated Explorer search-results component/test and Task 151 verification record; modify only the planned Explorer, search-hook, CSS, and copy owners/tests; additionally update only this minimum ledger state and the actual measured Task 151 workflow-pilot row |
| Dependencies | Tasks 114, 128, 134, 135, and 150 are `[x]`, Accepted; no Task 151 blocker is open |
| Issues / deviations | Four completed implementation-local bounded repairs. The explicitly approved fourth repair resolved the rejected checkpoint's three Important findings: pending selection now invalidates on Home/breadcrumb path intent; mounted document-capture Escape clears active/interrupted search from Scratch and external Staging/DnD focus while preserving DnD focus ownership/propagation; and the invalid direct-button `role=list` is now a native `ul > li > button` structure. No scope or canonical deviation. |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` for the already-approved `P28-04` selected-Bit release-edge correction; `None` for implementing the existing `DP-VQ07` and corrected Task 151 contract; no new canonical direction |
| Verification | Latest focused gate: 5 files / 86 tests. Latest full gate: 97 files / 1064 tests; lint 0 errors with 11 unchanged out-of-scope warnings; typecheck, production build, and `git diff --check` passed. Fresh fourth-repair Chrome 151 evidence verified a named native result list with two directly owned listitems, Explorer-external Scratch focus Escape clear/reopen state, and current-`ul` internal-only `0→1354` scrolling with every outer scroll fixed at `0`. Third-repair focus/theme evidence remains current for unchanged inputs; no Task 150 evidence was reused. Detailed evidence: `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-151.md`. |
| Review | Targeted rejection of `cb92805` named three Important findings. The explicitly approved fourth cycle repaired all three, and final sole-session review found no remaining Critical/Important finding in the bounded diff. |
| Next legal action | Return the clean committed Task 151 acceptance-only checkpoint to Control Tower review; Task 152 remains `[ ]` and unstarted |

## Task 150 Accepted Checkpoint

| User disposition | On 2026-08-26 the user accepted the exact Task 150 implementation checkpoint `14ade3c4eaa6e55a878addcc1367843f032098c2` and its `src` tree `73a1d973263f92d97580927063f27651482d18d3`; at that checkpoint the existing `P28-04` disposition was preserved and selected-Bit disappearance remained exclusively unstarted Task 151 scope |
| Exact added Task 150 scope | Create `src/hooks/use-explorer-remote-status.ts` and `.test.tsx`; modify `src/hooks/use-dnd.ts` and `src/hooks/use-triage-dnd.test.ts`, plus `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx` and `.test.tsx`, only for the authoritative provenance and stable local-result identity flow now recorded in Task 150 |
| Task 151 correction | The Task 150 checkpoint moved only selected-Bit disappearance realization to Task 151's existing search-reveal owner and added Task 150 as its dependency; it did not itself start Search or any Task 151 product behavior |
| Durable amendment mechanism | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` assigns execution corrections to the phase issue ledger and promotes executable ownership into `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; Adapter v2 declares no separate amendment receipt kind/path, so no new JSON was invented and no historical receipt was modified |
| Canonical alignment repairs | The first 2026-08-25 checkpoint finding corrected the VQ-06 Gate Register, `DP-VQ06-EXPLORER` Executable DP Receipt Edge, and completed Task 113 section to distinguish the unchanged 2026-08-10 Task-150-only history from the `P28-04` current split edge. The second evidence-confirmed finding qualified Task 113's remaining Verification sentence with that same historical/current distinction |
| Product/test writes | Exact Task 150 provenance hook/test, DnD stable-result producer/test, Workspace handoff and placement-dialog close-lifecycle test, Explorer/store/copy/CSS realization/tests, plus only `src/components/layout/grid-runtime.test.tsx` for the evidence-confirmed manual `useTriageDnd` mock compatibility repair |
| Repair evidence | The first full gate found 1/1016 failure because the GridRuntime test's manual DnD mock omitted the new return-contract field and supplied `undefined` to the real Explorer path; the fourth cycle added only `localPlacementResult: null`. The fifth cycle preserved typed `{type,id}` identity, registered successful local results before authoritative emission, completed the seven non-default count-theme roles, and repaired the remote-action scroll/focus interaction. The user explicitly approved one sixth cycle after review confirmed that Explorer focused before the production Radix placement dialog released its trap. Production-owner RED reproduced both final-focus destinations ending on `<body>` after a write-free close. The repair now hands the fallback operation from Explorer to Workspace and consumes it through the existing `DialogContent.onCloseAutoFocus`; both actual-dialog cases retain the valid ancestor row or destination full-label heading, select no sibling/ghost, and perform no confirm/write. No seventh cycle was used. |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` for `P28-04`; `None` for the compatibility-test and sixth-cycle close-lifecycle repairs. Product/design/placement semantics and the historical receipt remain unchanged. |
| Verification | Latest sixth-cycle input: focused 7 files / 179 tests, full 96 files / 1020 tests, lint 0 errors with 11 unchanged warnings, typecheck, build, and `git diff --check` passed. The mounted Workspace/Radix owner tests directly proved the affected close/focus interaction, so the user-conditional sixth-cycle browser run was not required. Fifth-cycle Chromium theme/focus-visible/reduced-motion evidence remains historical for unchanged CSS inputs and was not reused for the changed stale-placement focus input. |
| Next legal action | Historical Task 150 boundary: stop at its clean acceptance checkpoint; Task 151 then remained `[ ]` and required the separately approved run-task lifecycle now recorded in `Task 151 Accepted Checkpoint`. |

## Task 149 Durable Start

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `149 — Implement release-time targets and valid-column edge auto-scroll` |
| State | `Accepted`; Task 149 `[x]` |
| Exact scope | Existing DnD target/auto-scroll mechanics in `src/hooks/use-dnd.ts`, `src/components/triage/hierarchy-explorer.tsx`, and `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx`; their three approved test files; Task 149 verification evidence; Phase 28 workflow-pilot measurement row |
| Approval | Exact Task 149 fresh-session user instruction on 2026-08-24, bounded by `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_28.gate-c.json` |
| Approved base | `8cb2d904a55c136ca319e7bdf619d8e5d962fce8` |
| Kickoff recovery anchor | `fcafd49def7334299972e99d675db025d0598a79` |
| Baseline audit anchor | `4c526f0` (`docs: preserve Phase 28 workflow pilot baseline`) |
| Accepted checkpoints | Implementation `1830cc37ff913bd1d4ad4b62ddd9f7b2319b4dca`; evidence alignment/current recovery anchor `80bd7041e9db2849d9eab1d9f8d5d08c38e84549`; WF28-02 composite `a2da7ab6f49ba50d9fba9d3ea5e3fb568990e05f264891844e2534e2e00dfdd8` |
| Dependencies | Tasks 134 and 142 accepted; no unresolved Task 149 prerequisite |
| Issues / deviations | None at start |
| Canonical impact | `None` — Task 149 implements the existing approved contract without changing canonical product, design, policy, or plan authority |
| Next legal action | Fresh candidate-pinned `$run-task` lifecycle for Task 150; Task 150 remains `[ ]` and unstarted |

### Task 149 Review Blockers

| ID | State | Evidence | Exact minimum repair | Canonical impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P28-01` | `Closed` | Fourth-cycle RED reproduced no-post-activation mouse release and stationary-touch activation; focused owner tests now prove retained coordinates and release-time rendered target selection. | Accepted with Task 149 at the recorded implementation and evidence-alignment checkpoints. | `None` — implementation-local correction to the existing Task 149 contract. |
| `P28-02` | `Closed` | Fifth-cycle mounted Explorer-to-hook RED reproduced same-ID payload staleness; complete rendered identity now includes drop ID, parent, level, title, and path, and changed identity reissues the stale-guarded occupancy classification. | Accepted with Task 149; WF28-02 preserves the accepted product-input identity. | `None` — implementation-local correction to the existing Task 149 contract. |
| `P28-03` | `Closed` | Fifth-cycle mounted Explorer-to-hook RED reproduced late frame work after exit, blur, remote invalidation, Escape, and end. Hook refresh is now inert after pointer/cancellation loss; Explorer clears its local pointer and canceled callbacks return before work. | Accepted with Task 149 at the recorded implementation and evidence-alignment checkpoints. | `None` — implementation-local correction to the existing Task 149 contract. |

Task 149 is `[x]` and Accepted by the user's explicit checkpoint disposition.
The fifth bounded repair cycle resumed from recovery anchor
`77b762e15a3fea8c80ced07ba8fdaf16679593c3`; final review found no Critical or
Important issue, so no sixth cycle was started. Task 150 remains `[ ]` and
unstarted; no canonical direction change or scope expansion occurred.
