## Readiness Evidence

- Candidate `run-phase` authority was branch
  `post-v1/workflow-candidate-low-cost` at
  `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49`; the global live lifecycle
  skills were not used.
- The Adapter v2 resolver returned `approval_required`,
  `contract_ready=true`, and `writes_allowed=false` before Gate C.
- After `git fetch origin`, local `main` and `origin/main` both resolved to the
  approved base with ahead/behind `0/0` and a clean integration worktree.
- The Phase 26 publication tip, approved canonical-document commits, and Task
  136 dependency acceptance commits for Tasks 120, 128, 130, and 132 are
  ancestors of the approved base.
- The canonical plan declares Phase 27 Tasks 136–148 and a sequential first
  batch of Task 136 only. Flow ownership remains `PASS` with Weak 0 and Gap 0.
- Task 136's prescribed existing component/hook/test paths and Task 120
  authoritative Add/Delete APIs are present. The new operation-lock hook and
  test are absent as expected. The exact retired
  `deleteScratchBreakdownsByScratch` test mock/no-call assertion remains for
  Task 136-owned `P23-02` cleanup. No plan/code drift was found.
- Task 136 is headless and chooses no `VQ-05` appearance. No open typed
  decision receipt, active issue, or blocker applies to the first batch.
- Before Gate C, the proposed branch was absent locally/remotely and the
  proposed worktree path was absent and unregistered.

## Clean Start And Full Base Gate

- Immediately after creation, `HEAD` equaled the approved base, the worktree
  was clean, `approved-base..HEAD` contained zero commits, and the base tree
  matched exactly.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` exited 0; the lockfile was unchanged and
  537 packages were linked with pnpm 10.22.0 on Node 26.0.0.
- The Adapter v2 full gate ran serially:

| Command | Exit | Relevant result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `pnpm test` | 0 | 92 test files and 743 tests passed |
| `pnpm lint` | 0 | 0 errors; 11 pre-existing warnings |
| `pnpm typecheck` | 0 | `tsc --noEmit` passed |
| `pnpm build` | 0 | Next.js 16.2.1 production build passed; seven routes generated |

The baseline `src` tree is
`dba57c9e4da8639e98b4d966750835cb3895102c`. No product implementation was
started and `$run-task`, relay, and Control Tower were not invoked.

## Active Issues

Tasks 139–140 discovered two targeted canonical-scope conflicts. Task 144
discovered one pre-implementation canonical write-set/API conflict. The ledger
also retains the terminal Task 136 verification-staging conflict and accepted
Task 138 targeted canonical repair:

| ID | Status | Finding | Approved disposition | Canonical impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P27-01` | Closed | Task 136 required canonical-route `unknown reconcile`, but its production route can only enter and retain unknown state; Task 143 owns the `Check again` production trigger that starts reconciliation. A test-only trigger would not prove a production consumer. | On 2026-08-14 the user approved route verification through unknown row/lock/focus and blocked actions in Task 136, retained Add/Delete reconciliation and terminal-release verification at hook level in Task 136, and kept route `Check again` → reconciliation → terminal/focus in Task 143. On 2026-08-18 the user accepted Task 143 checkpoint `5ce2ddf0310e68b56b49d699856a179a7c7c7b1f`, confirming that the combined Task 136/143 production reconciliation contract is fulfilled. | `Reflected` in the accepted Task 136 and Task 143 verification clauses of `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; Task 143 is marked `[x]` and no further `P27-01` work remains. |
| `P27-02` | Closed | The accepted Task 138 realization and its two active visual recipes allowed editor state content to expand the source geometry; the experiment also initially imposed a no-horizontal-movement stop condition. | On 2026-08-18 the user approved the bounded fixed-geometry repair, disclosed caret-following result, recipe correction, exact-source browser evidence, Task 160 compatibility deferral, and repaired checkpoint `a7ab647d3b6733c9452979bac4a9ef5cbba9a9b4`; experiment commit `4c22b8c` records the stop-condition change. | `Reflected` in `DP-VQ04` in `docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md`, accepted Task 138 and the retained Task 160 compatibility tag in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, both active visual recipes, Task 138 evidence, and this ledger. |
| `P27-03` | Closed | Task 139 requires synchronous pre-mutation capture/blocking for Scratch, Explorer path, and app-route destinations plus destination focus handoff, but its original canonical file list named only the new hook, Workspace, Breakdown, and operation-lock tests. The actual pre-mutation owners are Scratch Pool selection, Hierarchy Explorer path actions, Sidebar route actions, and the globally mounted Search result route action; a Workspace Zustand subscriber can only roll back after forbidden state was observable. | On 2026-08-18 the user approved targeted Task 139 canonical scope expansion to the exact actual Scratch, Explorer path, and Inbox SPA navigation owners/tests plus the minimum common coordination owner. `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` now names `scratch-pool`, `hierarchy-explorer`, `sidebar`, and `search-overlay` with their tests, preserves the existing hook/Workspace/Breakdown/lock scope, requires pre-mutation guards and destination focus, and excludes inactive Inbox Breadcrumbs/GridView owners. The accepted implementation repaired every resulting blocking review finding inside that exact owner set. | `Reflected` in Task 139's exact files/actions and observable acceptance in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; implementation checkpoint `0dcaf26c2c1843870771bde10b307d2b124f8326` was accepted and no Task 140 surface was started. |
| `P27-04` | Closed | Task 140 canonical-route verification proved that Discard synchronously calls the captured destination focus while the departure sheet and surrounding `inert` state are still committed. Scratch selection and draft clearing succeed, but the inert Scratch-row focus is rejected and the Discard action's later unmount leaves focus on `BODY`. | On 2026-08-18 the user approved a bounded Task 140 fourth-cycle expansion to only `src/hooks/use-triage-departure.ts` and its test. The repair preserves the latest successful Discard focus intent and consumes it once in layout phase after `pendingDestination=null` commits, while destination mutation remains synchronous and exactly once. Continue, blocked/no-pending/failed Discard, direct no-draft, replacement, navigation, no-queue, no-replay, and stale-intent contracts are covered. Canonical Scratch, Path, and Route verification passed without opening another owner. | `Reflected` as a timing-only accepted-Task-139 dependency repair in Task 139 and accepted Task 140 in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; final hook tests pass 21/21, canonical Scratch/Path/Route focus handoff passes, Tasks 139–140 remain `[x]`, Task 141 remains `[ ]`, and canonical impact is limited to the approved focus-handoff timing. |
| `P27-05` | Closed | Task 144 requires exact mounted-page remote-arrival and archive/delete/restore aggregates while excluding local creation. Its original canonical production write set named only `ScratchPool`, centralized copy, CSS, tests, and evidence, but the component's sole authoritative input, `useInbox().activeScratchBits`, exposed only the current active projection. A disappeared row carried no archive-versus-delete cause, and an appearing active row carried no local-create-versus-remote-arrival-versus-restore provenance. | On 2026-08-19 the user approved the minimum canonical scope expansion to only `src/hooks/use-inbox.ts` and `.test.tsx`. The existing owner derives typed provenance from authoritative repository snapshots, excludes the initial snapshot and current-session local `createScratchBit`, and distinguishes remote arrival, external archive, external delete, and restore. DataStore/schema/persistence changes, timestamp inference, component repository lookup, another production owner, and Task 145+ remained prohibited. The user accepted the completed Task 144 checkpoint `86efb2be79c22a476d340924ca56dc2ef8e9cf11`. | `Reflected` in Task 144's exact files/actions in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; implementation and verification completed at evidence checkpoint `32fb3cda63582915de1e842e4f34f4ac110a7907`, Task 144 is accepted and marked `[x]`, and no further `P27-05` work remains. |
| `P27-06` | Deferred | Persisted-dark reload can produce a React hydration mismatch because the pre-existing `ThemeToggle` server/client render differs between Moon and Sun before any Task 144 activity is injected. Clean/default storage does not reproduce it, and the same mismatch reproduces on the pre-Task-144 baseline. | On 2026-08-19 the user directed durable deferral outside Task 144 and Task 145. Comparative evidence is `docs/verification/inbox-triage/captures/task-144-hydration-baseline.json`. Product correction requires a separate future lifecycle and explicit write approval; no product code was changed. | `None` — this finding changes no canonical product, design, task, or Task 145 authority. |
| `P27-07` | Closed | Task 147 must render live Stage/Unstage pending, unknown, reconciling, and terminal status over Tasks 145–146, but its original production write set excluded the only mounted owner of those projections. `TriageWorkspaceContent` owns the command-bearing `useStagedCandidates` instance and passes its callbacks into `useTriageDnd`; the separately mounted `StagingZone` and `BreakdownPanel` hook instances never receive those operation transitions, and terminal outcomes are consumed inside `useDnd`. Component-only props or test fixtures would therefore not prove the canonical UI, focus, or lifetime behavior. | On 2026-08-21 the user confirmed checkpoint `1e296268c2b9d94c9393f42f25c08af6c661d18c` and approved the minimum Task 147 expansion to `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx` and `.test.tsx` so the existing mounted owner can project its authoritative state into Staging/Breakdown. Task 146 hook/DnD/integrity semantics remain unchanged. The user subsequently accepted exact Task 147 checkpoint `55e7e2ead6faccf4ba4c417fbe62521581b21252`. | `Reflected` in accepted Task 147's exact files/actions in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; the scope repair is complete and no further `P27-07` work remains. |
| `P27-08` | Deferred | The approved `P27-07` projection owner resolves Stage/Unstage operation visibility, but two accepted Task 147 states needed explicit disposition. Confirmed-orphan cleanup has no authoritative proof producer or production caller; invalidated drag and placement already have explicit signals but Task 147 had not named them. Inferring either state from candidate disappearance or generic placement closure would violate the accepted proof and lifetime contract. | On 2026-08-21 the user approved `activeDragItem.integrity === "invalidated"` and existing `onPendingPlacementInvalidated(dropId)` as the only invalidation authorities projected by `triage-workspace.tsx`; no `use-dnd` or Hierarchy Explorer change is permitted. Accepted Task 147 completes that explicit invalidation projection and retains confirmed-orphan copy/render in the headless state matrix. Confirmed-orphan production reachability and browser acceptance remain deferred to a future remote-authority lifecycle; no proof, caller, injector, tombstone, or repository authority may be invented. | Task 147's completed portion is `Reflected` in its files/actions and verification boundary. Confirmed-orphan production/browser reachability remains `Deferred`; the decision receipt is unchanged. |
| `P27-09` | Closed | Task 147 remote-arrival counts must exclude initial hydration and Scratch-switch loads while still detecting a later remote arrival into an authoritatively empty subsection. `useStagedCandidates` originally returned the same empty projection before its first live-query snapshot and after a ready empty snapshot, and exposed no snapshot readiness. The approved Workspace owner therefore could not distinguish those lifetimes without timing or first-nonempty inference. | On 2026-08-21 the user approved `src/hooks/use-staged-candidates.ts` and `.test.tsx` only for a read-only matching-snapshot readiness projection. First matching snapshot, including authoritative empty, becomes ready; changed/null Scratch never reuses prior readiness. Candidate truth/count/eligibility, integrity, commands, reconciliation, DnD, repository behavior, and inference heuristics remain unchanged. The user subsequently accepted exact Task 147 checkpoint `55e7e2ead6faccf4ba4c417fbe62521581b21252`. | `Reflected` in accepted Task 147's exact files/actions and provenance boundary; the readiness scope repair is complete and no further `P27-09` work remains. |
| `P27-10` | Closed | Task 148 must attach the one-shot Unstage success signal to the restored Breakdown row, but its original production write set excluded `TriageWorkspaceContent`, the mounted owner that directly consumes the authoritative local Unstage terminal result, operation ID, and source Breakdown row ID. `StagingZone` receives only pending/unknown/reconciling projections, which are removed before terminal projection; inferring success from their disappearance would violate `DP-VQ02`. | On 2026-08-22 the user approved the minimum Task 148 expansion to `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx` and `.test.tsx`. Workspace may project only `{kind, operationId, sourceBreakdownId}` from the local Unstage callback's first authoritative `applied` or `already_applied` result, including reconciliation authority for the same stable operation. Add retains its existing BreakdownPanel authority. `use-dnd`, hooks, datastore, repository semantics, Task 146/147 behavior/evidence, `P27-06`, and `P27-08` remain unchanged. The user subsequently accepted exact Task 148 checkpoint `29c383bf50193c837363f54f31cb5c5da59de7c0` with `src` tree `94f2d3cd08ba62d01ea00f77e5cb8362dc47e174`. | `Reflected` in accepted Task 148's exact files/actions in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; the approved scope repair is complete and no further `P27-10` work remains. |
| `P27-11` | Closed | Accepted Task 141 left component-level `liveQuery` and three direct `getDataStore()` reads in `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx`, violating the blocking DataStore facade and hook API boundaries in `docs/PLANNING_STANDARD.md`. | On 2026-08-23 the user approved the minimum conformance repair: create `src/hooks/use-external-scratch-removal-data.ts` and `.test.tsx`, modify only Workspace and its test, and add plan/ledger/evidence records. Preserve exact Task 141 behavior, copy, DOM, style, timing, focus, lifecycle semantics, ordering, normalization, and race guards; do not modify DataStore, stores, repositories, schema, Tasks 142–148 behavior/evidence, `P27-06`, or `P27-08`. The user subsequently accepted exact repair checkpoint `9a27ff7bcd3fe8b636651239908ac4e304ee9214` and unchanged `src` tree `3d266b66cbfa9b771e862707efa7bb8d71f6bc2a` with no material finding. | `Reflected` in accepted Task 141's files/actions in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; the exact `P27-11` repair is accepted and no further repair work remains. |
| `P27-12` | Awaiting User Decision | In the canonical `1440×900` GridDO light route with default `DESC` Breakdown sort, confirmed Add called `scrollIntoView({ block: "start" })` for the new top row, which could move the complete Selected Scratch Context out of view. | On 2026-08-24 the user approved a bounded accepted-Task-136 smoke repair limited to Breakdown component/test plus plan, ledger, and repair evidence. DESC now uses the minimum `nearest` handoff while ASC retains `end`; Add focus, sort order, command/reconciliation, and `Added.` identity/lifetime are unchanged. Manual smoke and acceptance remain user-owned. | `Reflected` in accepted Task 136 without reopening its `[x]` marker; implementation and skill-owned evidence are complete at `c56439a86a65ceeb836796710745f53d05fa3fd0`. |
| `P27-13` | Awaiting User Decision | A staged source grip was correctly rendered as a native disabled button, but its unconditional `cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing` classes still advertised draggable feedback on pointer hover. | On 2026-08-24 the user approved a bounded accepted-Task-145 smoke repair in the same exact files. The existing disabled predicate now selects `cursor-not-allowed`; only active grips receive grab/grabbing feedback. Stage/DnD semantics are unchanged. Manual smoke and acceptance remain user-owned. | `Reflected` in accepted Task 145 without reopening its `[x]` marker; implementation and skill-owned evidence are complete at `c56439a86a65ceeb836796710745f53d05fa3fd0`. |

## P27-12/P27-13 Bounded Smoke Repair Run State

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Repair batch | `P27-12` — accepted Task 136 Add viewport handoff; `P27-13` — accepted Task 145 staged-grip cursor |
| State | `P27-12/P27-13 Implemented; Awaiting Manual Smoke and Acceptance`; Tasks 136–148 remain accepted and marked `[x]` |
| Approved scope | Modify only `src/components/triage/breakdown-panel.tsx`, `src/components/triage/breakdown-panel.test.tsx`, `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, this ledger, and `docs/verification/inbox-triage/phase-27-smoke-repair.md` |
| Kickoff authority | User-approved 2026-08-24 ad-hoc repair work order. The run-phase Gate C receipt remains separate and was intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver; pinned candidate `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49` returned receipt-less `approval_required` with `contract_ready=true` as compatibility evidence only |
| Start base / entrypoint / recovery anchor | `2d9ec7deb4e367e36e564a05cda062a71121a7ec`; exact entrypoint `src` tree `3d266b66cbfa9b771e862707efa7bb8d71f6bc2a` |
| Scope lock | Minimum Add scroll and staged-grip cursor repairs only. Preserve Add focus/order/command/reconciliation/success identity and lifetime, ASC visibility, active grip feedback, and Stage/DnD semantics. No sticky Context, layout redesign, hooks, datastore, repository semantics, copy/CSS/recipe changes, `P27-06`, `P27-08`, Phase 28, phase close, publication, integration, or cleanup |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` — amend only accepted Task 136 and Task 145 acceptance wording for the approved repairs; all Task 136–148 markers remain `[x]` |
| Verification ownership | Codex owns focused/full adapter gates and diff review. The user owns the two exact phase-level manual browser smoke paths; Codex must not run or claim them |
| Implementation / final `src` tree | `c56439a86a65ceeb836796710745f53d05fa3fd0` — `fix(triage): repair phase 27 smoke handoffs`; `7b831a941d40631c2212d07a010f3c6b4a00e01a` |
| Verification | `docs/verification/inbox-triage/phase-27-smoke-repair.md`; RED produced the exact two expected failures, focused Breakdown passed 1 file / 116 tests, full passed 95 files / 982 tests, lint passed with 0 errors and the same 11 pre-existing warnings, typecheck/build/diff-check passed |
| Review | Final contract/diff review found no remaining Critical or Important repair finding. Only the approved five paths changed across the start, implementation, and evidence commits; browser smoke was not run or claimed |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean checkpoint. The user rechecks only the exact Add viewport/focus/one-shot signal path and staged disabled-grip actual cursor path, then explicitly accepts or returns targeted feedback |

## Task 136 Run State

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `136` — connect headless Add and Delete interaction behavior |
| State | `Accepted`; user-approved and marked `[x]` |
| Approved scope | Gate C `task_scope.task_136` plus the explicit Task 136-only user approval and the 2026-08-14 targeted canonical-repair approval; implementation remains limited to the listed Breakdown, Workspace, Pool, scratch-breakdown hook/tests, new operation-lock hook/tests, and Task 136 evidence, while this repair changes only `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, this ledger, and Task 136 evidence |
| Kickoff receipt | `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_27.gate-c.json` at Git blob `08c7a5e524f7a89bd10adc5cea71963f54870d38` |

| Dependencies | Accepted Tasks 120, 128, 130, and 132 are ancestors of the approved base |
| Deferred ownership | `P23-02` is included only in Task 136 hook/test replacement scope |
| Visual boundary | Headless only; Task 143 owns `DP-VQ05` Add/Delete reliability realization |
| Issues / deviations | `P27-01` — verification-staging conflict, user-approved and `Promoted to Execution Plan`; no product-scope deviation |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` — Task 136 now owns route evidence through retained unknown/blocked actions plus hook-level reconciliation, while Task 143 retains route `Check again` → reconciliation → terminal/focus |
| Implementation | `cf0b08db8d9be2a8c8653fa773c969b35d034569` — `feat(triage): connect locked breakdown commands` |
| Verification | `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-136.md`; focused 5 files / 110 tests, changed-file lint pass, typecheck and diff-check pass; canonical-route Add/Delete/lock/focus/scroll observations recorded; single adapter full gate passed 93 files / 769 tests, lint with 0 errors and 11 existing warnings, typecheck, and build and was not rerun for the documentation-only repair |
| Acceptance | On 2026-08-14 the user explicitly accepted checkpoint `318739fe1a528b2b8e62153bdd9b77905142b919` and approved this acceptance-only marker/ledger update; existing successful verification evidence was reused |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean Task 136 acceptance checkpoint; do not start Task 137 without a separate user-approved run-task scope |

## Task 137 Run State

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `137` — build headless conditional editor and blocker state |
| State | `Accepted`; user-approved and marked `[x]` |
| Approved scope | The committed canonical Task 137 contract in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` plus the explicit 2026-08-14 Task 137-only user approval: modify only the named scratch-breakdown hook/tests, Breakdown/Workspace component/tests, extend the operation-lock test, and record Task 137 verification evidence; consume Task 136's shared operation lock for the headless conditional Scratch-title/row editor and synchronous blocker state |
| Kickoff receipt | Run-phase Gate C receipt `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_27.gate-c.json` at Git blob `08c7a5e524f7a89bd10adc5cea71963f54870d38`; intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver |

| Dependencies | Accepted Tasks 120, 132, and 136 are ancestors of the approved Task 137 entrypoint |
| Excluded | `DP-VQ04` visual/copy realization, generic dialog, Task 139+, and Task 143 route `Check again` reconciliation UI |
| Issues / deviations | None |
| Canonical impact | `None` — Task 137 executes the already-reflected canonical contract without changing product/design/policy authority |
| Implementation | `bba0da00e5191364592931f612e016d2765acca6` — `feat(triage): model conditional inline edits` |
| Verification | `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-137.md`; initial missing-editor RED plus duplicate-open RED; final focused 4 files / 98 tests, changed-file lint and diff-check, typecheck; post-repair adapter full gate passed 93 files / 783 tests, lint with 0 errors and 11 existing warnings, typecheck, and build |
| Acceptance | On 2026-08-14 the user explicitly accepted checkpoint `d0bc011383b40c382b2ca46cd78653397f9b1e64` and approved this acceptance-only marker/ledger update; existing successful verification evidence was reused without rerunning tests |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean Task 137 acceptance checkpoint; do not start Task 138 without a separate user-approved run-task scope |

## Task 138 Run State

| State | `Accepted`; repaired checkpoint user-approved and marked `[x]` |
| Approved scope | The explicit 2026-08-18 ad-hoc work orders: replace only the Scratch-title and Breakdown-content visual realization in `src/components/triage/breakdown-panel.tsx`, its test, and `src/app/globals.css` with the approved fixed geometry; reflect the revised `DP-VQ04`/Task 138 contract and, in the docs-only follow-up, correct only the two active recipes, add the minimum Task 160 compatibility tag, update this ledger, and durably record exact-source Task 138 browser evidence without changing captures |

| Approved scope | The committed canonical Task 139 contract in `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, the explicit 2026-08-18 Task 139-only approval, and the 2026-08-18 `P27-03` targeted scope expansion: retain the existing hook/Workspace/Breakdown/operation-lock scope and add only the actual Scratch Pool, Hierarchy Explorer, Sidebar, and global Search route owners with their tests for pre-mutation coordination and destination focus |
| Kickoff receipt | Run-phase Gate C receipt `docs/issues/Issues_Phase_27.gate-c.json` at Git blob `08c7a5e524f7a89bd10adc5cea71963f54870d38`; intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver |

| Issues / deviations | `P27-03` — accepted implementation scope expansion; `P27-04` — post-acceptance focus-handoff timing dependency repair approved inside Task 140's fourth bounded repair cycle without changing Task 139 meaning |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` — Task 139's exact files/actions and observable acceptance name the verified owners and semantics; `P27-04` additionally fixes only when the already-required destination focus executes after the Task 140 decision DOM commits closed |

| Issues / deviations | `P27-04` — canonical-route Scratch Discard exposed pre-commit destination focus loss; the user approved the minimum Task 139 hook/test timing repair while retaining every existing semantic boundary |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` — Task 140 still executes accepted `DP-VQ03`; the only canonical repair is `P27-04` focus timing in accepted Task 139, with no new product/design policy |

| Verification | `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-141-conformance-repair.md`; focused hook + Workspace 2 files / 47 tests, full 95 files / 981 tests, changed-file lint, full lint with 0 errors and the same 11 existing warnings, typecheck, production build, and diff-check passed. Representative local Chrome archive restore and delete terminal handoff passed; accepted 16-theme geometry was not rerun because CSS/DOM/copy are unchanged. Initial review's one Important same-Scratch fallback race was reproduced, repaired, and cleared by follow-up review with no remaining Critical/Important/Minor finding. |

The run-phase Gate C receipt remains separate and was intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver; pinned candidate `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49` returned receipt-less `approval_required` with `contract_ready=true` as compatibility evidence only |
| Requested start base / entrypoint / recovery anchor | `8022301e9d198560378ac3f9bd2e29bdf8dfd86f`; exact entrypoint `src` tree `940c5ce559c1de68bba71435d81ee4b7a3207cc9` |
| Dependencies | Tasks 111, 128, and 130 are accepted and marked `[x]`; Task 143 is the accepted immediate predecessor |
| Behavior | `useInbox` now projects typed authoritative remote arrival/archive/delete/restore provenance while excluding initial and local-create snapshots; `ScratchPool` owns exact hidden-selection, aggregate, compact marker, action, focus, dismissal, mounted lifetime, reduced-motion, and eight-theme presentation without changing selection or querying repository lifecycle directly |
| Issues / deviations | `P27-05` — user-approved minimum canonical expansion, completed and `Closed`; the approved extra repair cycle moved Pool static motion into the global base layer. `P27-06` durably defers the comparative-evidence-backed, pre-existing persisted-dark `ThemeToggle` Moon/Sun hydration mismatch outside Task 144 and Task 145, resolving the checkpoint's `Unowned` disposition without an out-of-scope product repair. Final visual review also replaced an undefined Pool-only shadow variable with existing approved theme-family values. |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` — Task 144 now names the exact typed provenance owner/test and retains every existing `DP-VQ06-POOL` behavior and exclusion |
| Durable resume/start | Resume checkpoint `3812cf8662372e1e16371de9985d1893be2f139e`; this canonical/ledger commit precedes every production/test write |
| Implementation | `d25ec44fe0448aea17c6b5b70eb746b2f01b03c6` — `feat(triage): render pool statuses`; repairs `0f71ceb5e8c84afeb5affdf98733ca345872f185`, `733155a17d548a55c3d5adc132a5d2fad1ce495b`, and `a07937f4bcb80edeb0db90441c5abe4cbacf710a`; final `src` tree `0f7b18f359e9c433bc217136ed0f24bd66cb74a7` |
| Verification | `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-144.md`; focused 3 files / 58 tests, full 94 files / 919 tests, changed-file lint, full lint with 0 errors and 11 existing warnings, typecheck, production build, and diff-check passed; canonical Chrome passed hidden selection, remote/lifecycle provenance, focus/actions/lifetime, exact `0s` reduced motion, and 16 theme-mode runs with zero overflow or Task 144 console/page errors; current/baseline hydration comparison is recorded separately |
| Review | Final diff/interaction/visual review found and repaired the base-layer motion precedence and undefined Neumorphism/Claymorphism inset variable. No remaining Critical or Important Task 144 finding; the unchanged persisted-dark ThemeToggle hydration mismatch remains outside Task 144 per user direction. |
| Acceptance | On 2026-08-19 the user explicitly accepted checkpoint `86efb2be79c22a476d340924ca56dc2ef8e9cf11` and approved this acceptance-only marker/ledger update; the existing successful focused/full gates and canonical 16 theme-mode browser evidence were reused without rerunning verification. |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean Task 144 acceptance checkpoint; wait for a separately approved Task 145 lifecycle and do not start Task 145. |

## Task 145 Run State

| Approved scope | The committed canonical Task 145 contract and the user's 2026-08-19 Task 145-only candidate-pinned work order: modify only the named Breakdown, Staging, Workspace, staged-candidate hook, existing DnD owner, their named tests, operation-lock tests, Task 145 verification evidence, and this ledger |
| Kickoff authority | The user supplied an approved Task 145 ad-hoc work order. The run-phase Gate C receipt remains separate and was intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver; pinned candidate `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49` returned receipt-less `approval_required` with `contract_ready=true` as compatibility evidence only |

| Dependencies | Tasks 121, 131–133, 136, 139, and 142 are accepted and marked `[x]`; Task 144 is the accepted immediate predecessor; no known Task 145 blocker exists |
| Scope lock | Headless current-snapshot Stage/Unstage dispatch, shared-lock lifecycle, complete blocked-intent matrix, transient Unstage targets, confirmed order/focus restoration, focused tests, and evidence only; no Task 146 remote/orphan work, no `DP-VQ06-STAGING` Task 147 UI, no permanent Unstage button, no success toast, and no `P27-06` repair |
| Issues / deviations | The first full gate exposed one existing `grid-runtime` whole-module mock compatibility failure after a new named DnD export was introduced. The implementation kept collision ownership inside the existing `useTriageDnd` controller instead; no external test or out-of-scope owner changed. No remaining Task 145 issue or deviation. |
| Canonical impact | `None` — implementation-local execution of the already approved Task 145 contract |
| Implementation | `21d87bd9e02633e309cda0e989d0d87cfb4aaba3` — `feat(triage): connect stage and unstage flows`; final `src` tree `923050fab27a61d186c0e45c8f3026f3c29f3b5a` |

| Review | Final contract/diff/browser review found no remaining Critical or Important Task 145 issue. Task 146 remote/orphan logic, Task 147 UI, permanent controls/toasts, unrelated canonical/product files, and `P27-06` remain untouched. |
| Acceptance | On 2026-08-20 the user explicitly accepted checkpoint `27298c15a13fa94bf53dd0d6eea28ace9d97e18d` and approved this acceptance-only marker/ledger update; the existing successful focused/full gates and canonical browser evidence were reused without rerunning verification. |

| Acceptance | On 2026-08-21 the user approved exact checkpoint `7dc8ca657001f71eba7e87645e61817c5bd466e1` with no material finding; its parent is `43d7d1aa39dbda914d434497f680374df6e05dd7`, and the accepted `src` tree remains `45e8d4401dc35ca05bd4fb8d5953fc6030f92ed6` |
| Approved scope | The committed canonical Task 146 contract and the user's 2026-08-21 Task 146-only candidate-pinned work order: modify only `src/hooks/use-staged-candidates.ts` and `.test.tsx`, `src/components/triage/staging-zone.tsx` and `.test.tsx`, existing `src/hooks/use-dnd.ts` and `src/hooks/use-triage-dnd.test.ts`, Task 146 verification evidence, and this ledger |
| Kickoff authority | The user supplied an approved Task 146 ad-hoc work order. The run-phase Gate C receipt remains separate and was intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver; pinned candidate `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49` returned receipt-less `approval_required` with `contract_ready=true` as compatibility evidence only |

| Scope lock | Headless remote candidate/source reconciliation, exact confirmed-orphan proof/identity cleanup, reactive count/Archive facts, release-safe active-drag invalidation, focus/selection preservation, Task 147 typed slots, focused tests, and evidence only; no unresolved subscription miss as proof, no Task 147 `DP-VQ06-STAGING` copy/DOM/style UI, no proofless cleanup or invalid drag mutation, no `P27-06` repair, and no unrelated canonical/product change |
| Issues / deviations | No contract deviation. TDD/diff review closed blind resend after unknown and terminal no-retry gaps. Independent review found one Important hook-remount reconciliation gap and one Minor public typed-slot gap; both were reproduced and repaired within the approved owners, and re-review found no remaining Critical or Important finding. |
| Canonical impact | `None` — implementation-local execution of the already approved Task 146 contract |

| Verification | `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-146.md`; focused 3 files / 79 tests, full 94 files / 949 tests, changed-file lint, full lint with 0 errors and the same 11 existing warnings, typecheck, production build, and diff-check passed. Verification-only continuation added canonical two-tab browser evidence for remote arrival/removal focus preservation and a real held drag retaining its exact token through authoritative invalidation until a mutation-free release; artifact: `docs/verification/inbox-triage/captures/task-146-browser-report.json` |
| Review | Independent re-review found no remaining Critical or Important Task 146 issue. Unresolved subscription miss remains non-proof; cleanup and reconciliation are exact and retry-safe; Task 147 UI, `P27-06`, unrelated canonical/product files, and publication/integration remain untouched. |

## Task 147 Run State

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `147` — render `DP-VQ06-STAGING` Staging statuses |
| State | `Accepted`; the user-approved exact Task 147 checkpoint is committed and Task 147 is marked `[x]`; Task 148 remains `[ ]` and untouched |
| Approved scope | The committed canonical Task 147 contract, accepted `DP-VQ06-STAGING` receipt, the user's 2026-08-21 Task 147-only candidate-pinned work order, and approved `P27-07` through `P27-09`: modify only the named Staging, Breakdown, centralized copy, CSS, tests, Task 147 verification/browser evidence, this ledger, `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx` plus `.test.tsx` solely as the mounted authoritative projection owner, and `src/hooks/use-staged-candidates.ts` plus `.test.tsx` solely for read-only matching-snapshot readiness |
| Kickoff authority | The user supplied an approved Task 147 ad-hoc work order. The run-phase Gate C receipt remained separate and was intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver; pinned candidate `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49` returned receipt-less `approval_required` with `contract_ready=true` as compatibility evidence only |

| Dependencies | Tasks 112, 128, 145, and 146 are accepted and marked `[x]`; accepted Task 146 is the immediate predecessor |
| Scope reconciliation | `P27-07` adds only the mounted Workspace projection owner; `P27-08` binds invalidation to existing explicit signals and defers confirmed-orphan production/browser reachability; `P27-09` adds only read-only matching-snapshot readiness. Task 146 command/DnD/integrity semantics, Task 148, `P27-06`, repository behavior, orphan authority, and all unrelated owners remain excluded. |
| Durable resume/start | `1e296268c2b9d94c9393f42f25c08af6c661d18c` P27-07 drift → `5f14f09071aaa45de42a53860e6c0a809a52cabd` reflection → `504849f7b97d046f97fc706ba90e595825e0bb5c` P27-08 drift → `bdf2b5c07f66cd58e51d079f93bd7d43e2e58b6e` reflection → `b51f65d4e9d3468295fe1c582fec1a4fc9b18b75` P27-09 drift → `8b153b32fd10cafe3c3bbca4c396a84e2be6d80c` canonical readiness start |
| Canonical impact | `Reflected` — Task 147 exact files/actions name the minimum mounted projection and read-only readiness owners without changing product/design meaning |
| P27-08 disposition | Invalidated drag/placement uses only the existing explicit `activeDragItem.integrity` and `onPendingPlacementInvalidated(dropId)` signals through Workspace. Confirmed-orphan copy/render is headless-only; production reachability/browser acceptance is deferred without creating authority or using disappearance inference. |
| P27-09 disposition | The existing candidate hook may expose only matching-snapshot readiness. Initial and Scratch-switch snapshots seed the remote-arrival baseline; authoritative empty is ready and later arrival remains distinguishable without timing, first-nonempty, or render-count inference. |

| Issues / deviations | Browser verification found same-tab Stage could be counted as remote when the command resolved before its authoritative snapshot; repaired within the approved Workspace projection/test scope. No remaining blocker or additional scope drift. |
| Acceptance | On 2026-08-21 the user explicitly accepted checkpoint `55e7e2ead6faccf4ba4c417fbe62521581b21252` as the exact Task 147 checkpoint and approved this acceptance-only marker/ledger commit; existing focused/full/browser evidence was reused without rerunning verification. |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean Task 147 acceptance checkpoint; Task 148 remains `[ ]` and may start only through a separate user-approved run-task scope. |

## Task 148 Run State

| Field | Durable value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | `148` — render `DP-VQ02` Add/Unstage success signal |
| State | `Accepted`; the user-approved exact Task 148 checkpoint is committed and Task 148 is marked `[x]` |
| Approved scope | The committed canonical Task 148 contract, accepted `DP-VQ02` receipt, the user's 2026-08-22 Task 148-only candidate-pinned work order, and approved `P27-10`: modify only Breakdown, Staging, centralized copy, CSS, their tests, Task 148 verification/browser evidence, this ledger, and `src/components/triage/triage-workspace.tsx` plus `.test.tsx` solely as the mounted authoritative local Unstage success projection owner |
| Kickoff authority | The user supplied an approved Task 148 ad-hoc work order. The run-phase Gate C receipt remains separate and was intentionally not passed to the run-task resolver; pinned candidate `94e89782f7fe2cdbdd035e842ca6881b4a87ce49` returned receipt-less `approval_required` with `contract_ready=true` as compatibility evidence only |
| Start base / entrypoint / recovery anchor | `841d6cc129db40b37fd1388498fabc7b7adf8358`; exact accepted entrypoint `src` tree `a94b637c16cb407879cc7fa5736e900edb909580` |
| Dependencies | Tasks 107, 128, 136, and 145 are accepted and marked `[x]`; accepted Task 147 is the immediate predecessor checkpoint |
| Scope reconciliation | `P27-10` adds only the mounted Workspace projection owner. The projection is sourced directly from the current local Unstage callback's authoritative terminal result and never from disappearance, rerender, reload, remote events, or Staging projection removal. `use-dnd`, hooks, datastore, repository semantics, Task 146/147 behavior/evidence, `P27-06`, and `P27-08` remain excluded. |

| Verification | Focused Task 148: 4 files / 188 tests; full: 94 files / 974 tests; lint: 0 errors with the same 11 pre-existing warnings outside Task 148; typecheck/build/diff-check passed; production Chromium covered real Add, pointer Stage→Unstage, active-row/focus/announcement/lifetime/reload non-replay, all eight themes, and reduced motion. Durable evidence: `docs/verification/inbox-triage/task-148.md`. |
| Issues / deviations | `P27-10` is closed after acceptance of the completed targeted scope repair. Review-found delayed-projection and inline-edit lifetime defects were repaired inside the approved Breakdown owner and covered by focused regressions; follow-up review found no remaining issue. Blocker: none. |
| Acceptance | On 2026-08-22 the user explicitly accepted checkpoint `29c383bf50193c837363f54f31cb5c5da59de7c0` and unchanged `src` tree `94f2d3cd08ba62d01ea00f77e5cb8362dc47e174` as the exact Task 148 checkpoint and approved this acceptance-only two-document commit; existing focused/full/browser evidence was reused without rerunning gates. |
| Next legal action | Stop at the clean Task 148 acceptance checkpoint and wait for the separately approved Phase 27 smoke test. Do not start smoke testing, phase close, or Phase 28 in this lifecycle. |
